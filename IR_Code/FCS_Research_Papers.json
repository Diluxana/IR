The quantity of LNG is traded on the basis of energy transferred, calculated from volume, density and gross calorific value. High-speed, accurate density measurement is therefore of significant commercial value.The electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) device described in this paper has the potential to measure the LNG density rapidly, on-line at a moderate cost. Continuous monitoring of variation in LNG density during dynamic LNG flow measurement also gives a good indication of change in fluid quality and thus onset of boiling which is known to affect measurement accuracy. ECT is a leading candidate to be explored for online density measurements through measurement of electrical permittivity, as in addition to average value, it offers the image of permittivity across the whole flow conduit, allowing localised bubbles, boiling or other variations to be identified and measured.We report here experiments to explore the use of ECT in cryogenic applications. An 8-electrode test ECT sensor was designed, built and tested in laboratory conditions and then in liquid nitrogen. The resolution and imaging capability in cryogenic conditions are shown to be comparable to that under laboratory conditions. The experiments reported here use liquid nitrogen as an analogue fluid, but the results presented are believed to be representative of many cryogenic fluids. Although the use of ECT has been widely reported in the literature for multiphase flows in general, its use has not previously been reported for cryogenic flows. This paper offers proof of principle for ECT cryogenic multi-phase density and flow measurement.Dielectric constant is strongly linked to fluid density, and the ECT sensor design tested here shows an estimated measurement of the relative permittivity of liquid nitrogen of 1.45 with a standard measurement error of 0.034. Measurement stability at cryogenic conditions gave an rms variation of output under static conditions of better than 0.001 relative permittivity units even though it was unguarded and only a single electrode ring. The primary errors are associated with the unguarded nature of the test sensor, which was primarily designed as a proof of concept and material demonstrator.In addition, such an ECT sensor would provide clear images of any gas in the liquid and give a good estimation of the concentration and velocity of the gas bubbles. The scope of this work is to provide a proof of concept of the cryogenic ECT sensor."},

Comparisons are made with measurements obtained using a dual-sensor X-probe. A non-dimensional swirl number was used to characterise the swirl intensity obtained using both techniques. A good agreement was attained wherein a +-0.04 difference was obtained between the two techniques."},

The major trend of downsizing engines using turbochargers means the effect of the turbine residual swirl on the flow needs to be considered. In this paper, this effect has been investigated experimentally and numerically. A swirling flow rig with a moving-block swirl generator was used to generate swirling flow in a sudden expansion diffuser with a wash-coated diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) downstream. Hot-wire anemometry (HWA) was used to measure the axial and tangential velocities of the swirling flow upstream of the diffuser expansion and the axialvelocity downstream the monolith. With no swirl, the flow in the catalyst monolith is highly non-uniform with maximum velocities near the diffuser axis. At high swirl levels, the flow is also highly nonuniform with the highest velocities near the diffuser wall. An intermediate swirl level exists where the flow is most uniform. To gain further insight into the mechanisms controlling flow redistribution, numerical simulations have been performed using the commercial CFD code STARCCM+. With no swirl, the central jet transverses the diffuser, and a drastic flow redistribution takes place near the monolith face due to its high resistance. Immediately downstream of the sudden expansion, the flow separates from thediffuser wall forming a separation zone around the central jet. Increasing swirl reduces the size of this separation zone, and eventually leads to the formation of the central recirculation zone characteristic of high swirl flows. At intermediate swirl levels, the size of the wall separation zone is reduced considerably, while the axial adverse pressure gradient is insufficient to cause a central recirculation. Such a flow regime occurs at relatively low swirl levels (S ~ 0.23). This may have positive implications for aftertreatment system design with low residual swirl levels from the turbine, which might be tuned by adjusting the distance between the turbine and the catalyst or employing guide vanes. The findings can be directly transferred to other aftertreatment systems with a catalyst or particulate filter. Moreover, swirling flows with an obstruction or a high resistance device downstream (e.g. a heat exchanger or filter) are present in many other applications such as cooling flows, combustion and turbomachinery. Therefore the results are relevant to a much wider research and industrial community."},

Several additional models with different configuration of cafeteria layouts were proposed to achieve the required air temperature. It was found that the predicted results from the proposed models showed even distributions of airflow characteristics and temperature gradients.

Field measurement was conducted in this study, where the actual environmental conditions of a selected protected lobby and the major sources for space heat gain were systematically measured and studied. Besides, the energy consumption data of the building under study was also collected for energy management opportunities (EMOs) analysis. It was identified in the field assessments that the indoor thermal and visual comfort parameters were within acceptable levels. By following the recommended energy conservation schemes, it is possible to achieve a total reduction of approximately 16,000 kWh in building energy consumption annually, which provides a monetary saving of about 2,230 USD. For energy efficiency purpose, this study introduced a new method of reducing energy usage in the protected areas in buildings by taking the building safety requirements into consideration. Further savings are achievable by raising the thermostat settings during off-peak hours and replacement of the artificial lighting fixtures with the more energy efficient ones."},

Although genetic susceptibility would be an implausible explanation, the determinants of this upward trend and its spatial coordinates are poorly understood. We explored CLL incidence in Sardinia, Italy, using a validated database including the 1700 CLL cases diagnosed during 1974-2003. We applied Bayesian methods to map the CLL probability by administrative unit and Poisson regression analysis to investigate socioeconomic and environmental determinants adjusting by possible confounders. The standardized (Standard European population) incidence rate for the Sardinian population over the study period was 5.1 per 100,000 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 4.9 - 5.3), increased annually by 5.8% (95% CI 5.7 - 6.0) consistently by sex and age, and was more noticeable in urban areas. Five administrative units exceeded the 95% posterior probability of an elevated CLL incidence: these were rural areas spread over the regional territory, not suggestive of spatial clustering. The Poisson regression analysis showed that the risk was elevated in urban areas (RR\u202f=\u202f1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17), among residents \u2265 30 km from the nearest hospital (RR\u202f=\u202f1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.12), and with the local prevalence of cork harvesting (RR\u202f=\u202f1.62, 95% CI 1.12-2.34). Our results suggest that better access to healthcare facilities and improvements in diagnostic efficacy might have generated the observed upward trend in CLL incidence, along with contributing environmental factors."},

Methods: We used a validated database of 1974-2003 incident cases of hematologic malignancies among the resident population (all ages) of Sardinia, Italy, to describe the incidence of myeloid malignancies overall (N = 4389 cases) and by subtype. We investigated the time trend of acute myeloid leukemia (N = 1227 cases), chronic myeloid leukemia (N = 613 cases), and myelodysplastic syndrome (N = 1296 cases), and used Bayesian methods to explore their geographic spread, and Poisson regression analysis to estimate their association with environmental and socio-economic factors. Results: The annual standardized (world population) incidence rate (IR) of myeloid malignancies over the study period was 6.5 per 100,000 (95% CI 6.2-6.7). Myelodysplastic syndromes were the most prevalent subgroup (IR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.8). Incidence of all myeloid malignancies combined increased sharply during the study period with an annual percent change (APC) of 10.06% (95% CI 9.51-10.61), 19.77% for myelodysplastic syndromes (95% CI 19.63-19.91), and 3.18% (95% CI 2.99-3.37) for acute myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia did not show an upward trend. Apart from sporadic excesses in small rural communities and the major urban area, there was no evidence of spatial clustering. The risk of myeloid malignancies increased with increasing prevalence of sheep breeding. Conclusions: Our results might prompt further research on the local genetic and environmental determinants of myeloid hematologic malignancies."},

One advantage of this approach is that the Gaussian process model includes an estimate of the accuracy of the predicted expected value at any point within the parameter space, unlike direct interpolators often used as proxy models. When used as part of an optimisation process we can use the Gaussian process model to eliminate those areas where we have high confidence that the optimal solution will not be found. This allows the efficient targeting of resources on those areas of parameter space that could yield the optimal solution, and also facilitates a more global analysis of the parameter space. Gaussian Processes naturally provide clear visualisation of the objective surface at various stages of the optimisation, which generates insight into the optimisation process sometimes lacking in alternative approaches, and thus facilitate human validation/intervention if desired.To understand the theoretical basis of the approach requires a level of statistical knowledge that is not commonly found outside of the statistics community, which may have inhibited uptake. However, the approach can be easily implemented from first principles in python, using a recipe by Rasmussen and Williams, without needing a deep understand of the theoretical underpinning. The recipe has a small number of controls that need to be set by the user. In this paper we construct empirical models of the effect of these controls on the interpolation and explain their limitations from a theoretical perspective. We explore how dynamic adjustment of the controls might be used as part of an optimisation scheme.We apply our approach to the well placement optimisation problem. The reservoir model used for the exercise is the PUNQ Complex Model, which is a 2.4 million cell representation of a BRENT sequence reservoir. A combination of producers and injectors are sequentially placed in the model using a greedy algorithm with the optimal position at each iteration being selected using the Gaussian Process model as a proxy for the true objective surface. The result is compared to a manually derived solution by an experienced reservoir engineer which required 22 wells. The result obtained by this approach reaches the same level of performance using only 18 wells."},

Areas with the highest probability of an excess incidence tended to cluster in the north-eastern part of the region and in two major urban centers, with the low incidence areas located in the south, confirming previous observations. Prevalence of viral infections, environmental and occupational exposures, or socio-economic deprivation would not explain the peculiar geographic distribution we observed.

The current priority for Mars science is the recognition of definitive biosignatures related to past or present life. Success of life detection missions requires choices of the best mission design, location on Mars and particular sample to be analyzed. It is essential therefore to incorporate as much information as possible into the mission planning stages to maximize the precious opportunities provided by robotic operation on Mars. Bayesian statistics allow us to accommodate the many unknowns associated with a mission that has yet to take place. We have used Bayesian statistics to reveal that although in situ missions are less complex the overall probabilities of a successful mission to detect biosignatures on Mars are higher for sample return. If a mission has been designed with safe landing and operation as a priority, recognizing and avoiding those samples that do not contain the target biosignature is the most important characteristic, while for a mission where the best possible samples have been targeted the probability that the sample contains the target biosignature and that it can be correctly detected is the most dominant issue. Usefully, Bayesian statistics can be used to evaluate the chances of detecting past or present life for missions to different landing sites on Mars. A comparative assessment of Eberswelde Crater and Gale Crater indicates a higher probability of success for the latter and the probabilities of success are consistently higher for the sample return mission variant. Bayesian statistics, therefore, can inform future Mars mission planning steps to help maximize the possibility of success."},

Both contamination and confounding mineralogies have been suggested asalternatives to indigenous organic carbon. Intuitive thought suggests that we are repeatedly obtaining data thatconfirms the same level of uncertainty. Bayesian statistics may suggest otherwise. If an organic detection methodhas a true positive to false positive ratio greater than one, then repeated organic matter detection progressivelyincreases the probability of indigeneity. Bayesian statistics also reveal that methods with higher ratios of truepositives to false positives give higher overall probabilities and that detection of organic matter in a sample with ahigher prior probability of indigenous organic carbon produces greater confidence. Bayesian statistics, therefore,provide guidance for the planning and operation of organic carbon detection activities on Mars. Suggestions forfuture organic carbon detection missions and instruments are as follows: (i) On Earth, instruments should be testedwith analog samples of known organic content to determine their true positive to false positive ratios. (ii) On themission, for an instrument with a true positive to false positive ratio above one, it should be recognized that eachpositive detection of organic carbon will result in a progressive increase in the probability of indigenous organiccarbon being present; repeated measurements, therefore, can overcome some of the deficiencies of a less-thandefinitivetest. (iii) For a fixed number of analyses, the highest true positive to false positive ratio method orinstrument will provide the greatest probability that indigenous organic carbon is present. (iv) On Mars, analysesshould concentrate on samples with highest prior probability of indigenous organic carbon; intuitive desiresto contrast samples of high prior probability and low prior probability of indigenous organic carbon shouldbe resisted."},

Five provinces of Iran have been chosen as sampling sites and soil samples (150) were collected from these areas, and some properties of the soil samples were determined. The Gardner model has been fitted to the measured SMCC and CCC. The Gardner model's stress-void ratio coefficients, as well as the CCC properties, were used to estimate the soil moisture at five levels (five classes of variables) through the Gardner model using artificial neural networks (ANNs). A more accurate estimation of the water content was obtained by combining the basic soil properties, and three key properties of soil compression. In addition, the integral root mean square error (IRMSE) in the training and testing steps was reduced from 0.107 and 0.111 to 0.095 and 0.096, respectively. In conclusion, the use of CCC data to estimate the SMCC at all levels of the input variables indicated very favorable results with an increase in the accuracy of the water content estimation between 4% and 16% in both training and testing steps."},

The model concerns the regulation of turbulence by zonal and mean flow shear. Independent delta-correlated Gaussian stochastic noises are used to construct Langevin equations for the amplitudes of turbulence and zonal flow shear. We then find numerical solutions of the equivalent Fokker\u2013Planck equation for the time- dependent joint probability distribution of these quantities. We extend the earlier studies [Kim and Hollerbach, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023077 (2020) and Hollerbach et al., Phys. Plasmas 27, 102301 (2020)] by applying different functional forms of the time-dependent external heating (input power), which is increased and then decreased in a symmetric fashion to study hysteresis. The hysteresis is examined through the probability distribution and statistical measures, which include information geometry and entropy. We find strongly non-Gaussian probabil- ity distributions with bimodality being a persistent feature across the input powers; the information length to be a better indicator of dis- tance to equilibrium than the total entropy. Both dithering transitions and direct L-\u2013H transitions are (also) seen when the input power is stepped in time. By increasing the number of steps, we see less hysteresis (in the statistical measures) and a reduced probability of H-mode access; intermittent zonal flow shear is seen to have a role in the initial suppression of turbulence by zonal flow shear and stronger excitation of intermittent zonal flow shear for a faster changing input power."},

For the non-conserved Ising model a power-law growth of domains of like spins with exponent \u03b1 = 1/2 is predicted. Including recent work, it was not possible to clearly observe this growth law in the special case of a zero-temperature quench in the three-dimensional model. Instead a slower growth with \u03b1 < 1/2 was reported. We attempt to clarify this discrepancy by running large-scale Monte Carlo simulations on simple-cubic lattices with linear lattice sizes up to L = 2048 employing an efficient GPU implementation. Indeed, at late times we measure domain sizes compatible with the expected growthlaw\u2014but surprisingly, at still later times domains even grow superdifusively, i.e., with \u03b1 > 1/2. We argue that this new problem is possibly caused by sponge-like structures emerging at early times."},

The algorithm enables the development of an optimised complex industrial mould with relatively low computational cost. A transient model is validated against multiple experimental trials, providing an adapted interface heat transfer coefficient. A steady state thermal model, based on the casting cycle and thermal behaviour at the mould surface, is developed to evaluate the spatial distribution of temperature and to serve as the initial solution for the subsequent optimisation stage. The adjoint model is then applied to optimise the cooling channel emphasising the minimisation of the temperature standard deviation for the mould surface. The original transient model is applied to the optimised mould configuration via calibration using experimental data obtained from a dedicated aluminium furnace. The optimised cooling channel geometry, which uses a non-uniform cross-section across the entire pipe surface region, improves the pressure drop and cooling uniformity across the mould/cast interface by 24.2% and 31.6%, respectively. The model has been used to optimise cooling channels for a range of industrial high-pressure aluminium die-casting (HPADC) inserts. This has yielded a significant improvement in the mould operational lifetime, rising to almost 130,000 shots compared to 40,000 shots for prior designs."},

One goal is the provision of a dynamic uncertainty analysis, ideally incorporating the influence of instrument faults and the local environment. Such an analysis requires a broader model of instrument behaviour, accommodating non-ideal operational conditions. It may also require the analysis of a wider range of transducer data than when ideal, fault-free operation is assumed.A companion presentation describes an ultra-precise Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique. In this presentation, the technique is applied to a Coriolis mass flow meter, a resonant sensor with rich spectral characteristics. Typically, the meter is driven in a single natural mode of mechanical vibration; the frequency of this mode varies with fluid density, while the flow rate and density calibration coefficients assume a fixed frequency ratio to an adjacent vibration mode.A prototype Coriolis meter can operate in two modes of vibration simultaneously. The new FFT technique exhibits high precision (mode frequencies from the two independent vibration sensors agree by up to 10\u22128\u202fHz), allowing precise tracking of the true frequency ratio for on-line calibration and measurement validation. Additional transducer signal components, such as mains noise and external vibration, may be identified and monitored."},

This paper studied the nonlinear dynamics of a tunable VIV-based energy harvester. The energy harvester structure consists of a base-clamped cylinder having an adjustable mass (the tuner) which enables the system to actively synchronize with vortex-shedding frequencies. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the extended Hamilton\u2019s principle are used to extract the nonlinear partial differential equations of the distributed model for the cylinder, tuner motion, harvested voltage, and fluctuated lift force. The reduced-order model of the system of equations is derived via the Galerkin method using modified mode shapes. The method of multiple time scales is employed to obtain the approximated analytical solution of the 1:1 internal resonance of the lumped parameter system. The dynamical response of the system is shown by investigating various parameters of the harvester. Additionally, the locus of the points at which the higher orbits of harvested voltage occur is specified for the tuner equilibrium position. The results show the proposed design significantly increases energy harvesting performance by a factor of 900%. This paper is offered as a contribution towards energy harvester design and optimization with the goal of capturing higher energy orbits."},

The traceability chain provides the underpinning confidence required to verify meter performance, financial and fiscal transactions, and environmental compliance.

An important failure mode arises from loss/leakage of the silicon oil, whereby a portion of the internal volume is replaced by gas, usually air. Coupled nonlinear governing equations have been derived and solved in both static and dynamical states to describe the behavior of the external membrane, the interface oil including pockets of gas, and the sensing plate. Nonlinear behavior arises from the plate and membrane midplane stretching, and of course the behavior of the gas.

The Prism also has negligible design cost. Recent work has demonstrated how, using simple design rules, a chain of six Prisms can create a narrowband filter with arbitrary central frequency and bandwidth. In this paper, the technique is applied to spectral analysis of data, whereby a sequence of filters is applied to a data set to provide narrow frequency analysis, yielding accurate estimates of the frequencies and amplitudes of spectral peaks in the data. Although this time domain technique remains computationally expensive compared to the FFT, it can identify and reject spectral leakage, offering an alternative analysis for low amplitude and/or adjacent spectral peaks, including hidden tones, where FFT discrimination may be limited.

It is well-established that the mass flow and density measurements generated from multiphase flows are subject to large errors, and a variety of physical models and correction techniques have been proposed to explain and/or to compensate for these errors. One difficulty is the absence of a common basis for comparing correction techniques, because different flowtube designs and configurations, as well as liquid and gas properties, may result in quite different error curves. Furthermore, some researchers with interests in the modelling aspects of the field may not have suitable multiphase laboratory facilities to generate their own data sets. This paper offers a small data set that may be used by researchers as a benchmark i.e. a common data set for comparing correction techniques. The data set was collected at the UK National Flow Laboratory TUV-NEL, using air and a viscous oil, and provides experimental points over a wide flow range (8:1 turndown) and with Gas Volume Fraction (GVF) values up to 60%. As a first investigation using the benchmark data set, we consider how data sparsity (i.e. the flow rate and GVF spacing in the experimental grid) affects the accuracy of a correction model. A range of neural network models are evaluated, based on different subsets of the benchmark data set. The data set and some exemplary code are provided with the paper. Additional data sets are available on a web site created to support this initiative."},

It is based upon a Fourier-style double integration applied recursively via a sliding windows calculation. Either one or two outputs are generated. If there are two outputs, these form an orthogonal sine/cosine pair from which the properties of the input signal, such as amplitude, phase and frequency, can be calculated. Unlike conventional, convolution-based FIR filters, the Prism calculation is fully recursive, so it has a low computational cost, which is independent of window length. Other benefits include a linear phase response, and a low design cost, as the filter \u2018coefficients\u2019 are simply linearly spaced sine and cosine values. Although the Prism frequency response is relatively inflexible compared to conventional FIR and IIR filter designs, networks of Prisms can be designed to provide a wide range of responses. This talk will provide an introduction to the basic mathematics of the Prism, and describe some elementary Prism signal processing techniques such as signal tracking, notch and bandpass filtering, and the tracking of multiple frequency components in a signal. As a worked example, a Prism-based ultra-narrowband filter (say 1 billion samples in length) can run in real time on a single FPGA, whereas the conventional convolution-based equivalent would require supercomputing resources to run at the same sample rate.The talk will include a brief survey of current and future applications of Prism Signal Processing, and demonstrate how it matches the requirements for sensor development for the era of the Internet of Things.References[1] Henry, MP, Leach, F, Davy, M, Bushuev, O, Tombs, MS, Zhou, FB and Karout, S. \u201cThe Prism: Efficient Signal Processing for the Internet of Things\u201d, IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine, pp 2\u201310, December 2017.

Most algorithms are based on the Cartesian model, which is a discretization in time of the continuous state space model associated with the differential equation that is satisfied by a sinusoidal signal with constant amplitude and frequency. In order to handle the more realistic case where both amplitude and frequency are changing, this basic model is modified by including ad hoc extensions. This paper starts by deriving a differential equation that explicitly includes time varying amplitude and frequency, and it is shown that this can be reduced to a Bessel's equation of order 1/2 that has a closed form solution. This is used to derive an explicit expression for a discrete-time model, which forms the basis of an extended Kalman filter. Simulation results show that this algorithm outperforms other approaches, particularly for harmonic signals where the frequency is changing rapidly."},

Currently direct measurements of fuel flow to individual cylinders of an engine are not possible on-engine or in real-time due to a lack of available appropriate measurement techniques. The objective of this work was to undertake real-time Coriolis fuel flow measurement using GDI injectors on a rig observing fuel mass flow rate within individual fuel injections. This paper evaluates the potential of this technology - combining Coriolis Flow Meters (CFMs) with Prism signal processing together known as Fast Next Generation Coriolis (Fast NGC), and serves as a basis for future transitions on-engine applications. A rig-based feasibility study has been undertaken injecting gasoline through a GDI injector at 150 bar in both single shot mode and at a simulated engine speeds of 1788 and 2978 rpm. The results show that these injections can, in principle, be observed. In addition a number of features of the Fast NGC system unique to gasoline are discussed, and the repeatability of the technique is preliminarily assessed. The study concludes that the Fast NGC system has the potential to measure individual injector flow rates on-engine in real-time."},

The signal tracking as well as mass flow rate and density measurement performance is compared with that of a laboratory version of a commercial Coriolis transmitter with two-phase flow capability. The results show that the complex bandpass algorithms, coupled with flowtube control algorithms, reduce the standard deviation of the mass flow measurement by a factor of 3 or more in 50% of the experiments undertaken.

It is also well known that Coriolis meters have theability to determine the density of the fluid present within its internals. There is now an increased interest from the Oil and Gas industry in utilising this density measurement capability as the primary process value to be output from the technology in applications such as precision control for fluid property conditioning as well as fluid contamination monitoring and control applications. However, within the industrial environments in which these applications tend to be required it is common for there to be considerable fluctuation in the ambient conditions in which the meter is installed. This paper details research data obtained using NEL\u2019s \u2018Very Low Flow\u2019 single phasefacility. The rig has been modified to include a programmable temperature enclosure. The results clearly show significant drift in the calculated fluid density output by a Coriolis meter when it is subject to fluctuations in the surrounding ambient air. The fluid properties of the test medium were confirmed to be stableusing NEL\u2019s UKAS standard reference instrumentation. Using the high-resolution data sets obtained from this research programme, a modified density correction model to better compensate for these ambient temperature effects has beendeveloped and the improved performance from said model is demonstrated. The rig and test matrix which form the basis of the results were developed over two distinct research phases with input from several meter manufacturers and end users. The model demonstrates that correcting the reported fluid density for ambient variations is viable so that any system using the density value e.g. a PID control system, will not lose efficiency when the ambient air temperature varies. The resulting cost savings are therefore considerable.

Therefore, any change in the phase shift unrelated to fluid flow contributes to the mass flow error. Error sources can include external influences and non-idealities in the flow tubes. This article describes an experimental study of the influence of one of these factors - the boundary condition stiffness of the Coriolis flowmeter - on the mass flow error. In the experiments, we obtained a dependence of the mass flow error on the boundary condition stiffness. The maximum error exceeded the allowable range by more than ten times. This corresponds to the case when the modal frequency of the 'Coriolis flowmeter-pipeline' system coincides with the drive frequency. It should be noted that the studied error is caused by the zero shift and can change over time, for example, when the temperature changes. Further, we developed a method of diagnosing random zero shift of the Coriolis flowmeter caused by the condition of its mechanical support. The method is based on measurement and analysis of modal damping. To validate the method, we carried out experimental studies to evaluate modal damping depending on the boundary condition stiffness of the flowmeter, the water flow rate and in the conditions of the water-air mixture flow. The results of the laboratory tests confirmed the practical applicability of this method."},

Alternative techniques have been applied to analyze the ultrasonic response signals, obtained from a pressure sensor housing. These include Prism Signal Processing and the Matrix Pencil Method.

Formal trials took place at the UK National Flow Laboratory. A single synthetic oil was used; its viscosity was adjusted by controlling temperature. The results show that Coriolis metering is well suited to high viscosity oil/gas mixtures: in the formalized trials, mass flow errors for gas were mostly within 5% and for liquid were mostly within 2.5%.

A Prism-based CMFM prototype has been developed using a commercial flowtube and a dual ARM processor-based transmitter, which is capable of generating flow measurement updates at 48 kHz. This has been applied in a feasibility study to the tracking of fast (e.g. 1.5 ms) injections of diesel fuel on a laboratory rig at engine speeds of up to 4000 rpm equivalent and at fuel pressures of up to 100 MPa. Due to the high level of vibration in the system, Prism-based notch filtering is used to suppress undesired modes of flowtube vibration in the sensor signal. Individual flow pulses can be detected by the system, but the relatively long period of oscillation of the flowtube compared to the fuel injection duration results in a spreading out over time of each flow pulse measurement.

The method makes it possible to effectively estimate signal parameters from its samples which is the sum of complex exponentials. The number of exponentials is not assumed to be known in advance and can also be estimated using a singular value decomposition of a matrix constructed from the signal samples. The object of this work is a vector process - a set of signals having the same frequencies and damping factors (i.e., the same poles of the signal), but different complex amplitudes. Such signals occur, for example, when considering a phased array antenna, when it is necessary to evaluate the parameters of a signal generated by the same sources but coming from many antenna elements with their amplitudes and phases. A similar problem arises in the evaluation of signals parameters from two spatially-distributed motion sensors of a Coriolis flowmeter. When processing several signals with classical MPM, we obtain several different sets of poles of these signals, which then, for example, need to be averaged to obtain the desired values of the poles assumed to be the same for all signals. The proposed modification of the MPM works with the entire set of signals at once, giving one set of signal poles, and at the same time it proves to be more effective both in terms of speed and in the accuracy of determining the signal parameters. The algorithms of the classical MPM and its modifications for the vector process are presented, as well as numerical experiments with model and real signals taken from one of the commercially available Coriolis flowmeters Dul5. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate results in a shorter (approximately 1,5 times) time than the classical MPM."},

We classify the flow regimes based using qualitative and quantitative analysis into viscous fingering (low M), compact displacement (high M), and an intermediate transition regime (M \u2248 1). We use stability analysis to obtain theoretical phase boundaries between these regimes, which agree well with our analyses. At the macroscopic (sample) scale, we find that wettability strongly controls the threshold M (at which the regimes change). At the pore scale, wettability alters the dominant pore-filling mechanism. At very small M (viscous fingering regime), smaller pore spaces are preferentially invaded during imbibition, with flow of films of invading fluid along the pore walls. In contrast, during drainage, bursts result in filling of pores irrespective of their size. As M increases, the effect of wettability decreases as cooperative filling becomes the dominant mechanism regardless of wettability. This suggest that for imbibition at a given contact angle, decreasing M is associated with change in effective wetting from neutral-wet (cooperative filling) to strong-wet (film flow)."},

Current experimental and analytical filter models could be calibrated to predict the permeability of a specific filter. However, they fail to provide a reliable estimation for the dependence of the permeability on key parameters such as wall porosity and pore size.This study presents a novel methodology for experimentally determining the permeability of filter walls. The results from four substrates with different porosities and pore sizes are compared with several popular permeability estimation methods (experimental and analytical), and their validity for this application is assessed. It is shown that none of the assessed methods predict all permeability trends for all substrates, for cold or hot flow, indicating that other wall properties besides porosity and pore size are important.The hot flow test results show an increase in permeability with temperature, which is attributed to the effects associated with slip-flow. It is shown that the slip-effect magnitude also varies with the filter wall properties. Existing models that account for the effect of slip are assessed and are shown to underpredict the effect considerably for all four substrates. This is important for the prediction of through-wall losses in applications where permeability increase with temperature is a desirable effect. Further investigation is needed to consider the effect of the high temperatures in exhaust applications."},

In an inclined porous medium, the convective flow becomes intricate as it originates from a combination of diffusion and lateral flow, which is dominant near the source of the solute. Here, we investigate the role of inclination on the onset of convective instability by linear stability analyses of Darcy's law and mass conservation for the flow and the concentration field. We find that the onset time increases with the angle of inclination ($\\theta$) until it reaches a cut-off angle beyond which the system remains stable. The cut-off angle increases with the Rayleigh number, $Ra$. The evolving wavenumber at the onset exhibits a lateral velocity that depends non-monotonically on $\\theta$ and linearly on $Ra$. Instabilities are observed in gravitationally stable configurations ($\\theta \\geq 90^{\\circ},$) solely due to the non-uniform base flow generating a velocity shear commonly associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. These results quantify the role of medium tilt on convective instabilities, which is of great importance to geological CO$_2$ sequestration. "},

Current desalinization methodology involves excessive water consumption. Biochar has the potential to mitigate soil salinization while increasing water holding capacity. As a saline and sodic material, however, how it works and whether it can be used to sustain the agriculture at reduced water resource remain to be studied. Here, by monitoring transport of water, salts and nutrients in the profile of irrigation-silt soil during watering and evaporation in both laboratory and field in Kashgar oasis, Xinjiang, China, we find biochar exacerbates salinization upon application. This is changed, however, after several cycles of irrigation-evaporation due to strengthened salt leaching in irrigation and salt removal out of the depth through intensified top accumulation by evaporation, both resulting from increased capillary effect and thereby the enhanced movement of salts despite the competing electrical adsorption to the cations. The resulted salt distribution facilitates desalinization by removing the top 2 cm soil. Biochar also promotes evaporation after irrigation due to inceased water content and capillary suction. This is reversed once the soil cracks, a common phemomenon in irrigated land. Biochar counteracts the cracking through alleviation of soil compaction, saving tillage while lowering water evaporation, e.g., by 43% at 10% biochar. Our findings indicate that application of biochar changes salt distribution, enabling desalinization with little water consumption. Together with the effect of anti-fracturing and enhanced salt leaching, it lowers water demand substantially, providing a novel solution for agricultural sustainability in salt-affected regions."},

A key process on which successful injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifer relies on is the dissolution of CO2 in brine. CO2 dissolution improves storage security and reduces risk of leakage by (i) removing the CO2 from a highly mobile fluid phase and (ii) triggering gravity-induced convective instability which accelerates the downward migration of dissolved CO2. Our understanding of CO2 density-driven convection in geologic media is limited. Studies on transient convective instability are mostly in homogeneous systems or in systems with heterogeneity in the form of random permeability distribution or dispersed impermeable barriers. However, layering which exist naturally in sedimentary geological formations has not received much research attention on transient convection. Therefore, we investigate the role of layering on the onset time of convective instability and on the flow pattern beyond the onset time during CO2 storage. We find that while layering has no significant effect on the onset time, it has an impact on the CO2 flux. Our findings suggest that detailed reservoir characterisation is required to forecast the ability of a formation to sequester CO2."},

Simulations reveal a significant effect of anisotropy on wormholing dynamics and medium permeability evolution. Particularly, anisotropy controls wormhole competition and their characteristic spacing. It also affects the flow through the individual wormholes and their shapes, and consequently, shifts the optimum injection rate at which breakthrough is achieved at a minimal expense of reactant. For anisotropic media with low transverse pore conductivities, wormhole distribution ceases to be scale-invariant and pronounced side-branches develop.Wormholing is further compared to viscous fingering in an anisotropic network, and other unstable growth processes of similar underlying dynamics. Despite several similarities, few important differences are identified. Our findings contribute to the understanding of wormholing in geological media and demonstrate how pore-scale features can fundamentally affect the emergence of large-scale morphologies.   "},

During drying, capillary forces can displace solid particles and modify invasion thresholds, opening preferential paths for air to invade.Since drying rates are crucially dependent on liquid connectivity through the porous medium, they are affected by the drying patterns. We study the interplay between solid matrix deformation and drying patterns and rates, and the impact of pore-size heterogeneity and the confining stress in a granular material. We couple a pore-scale model of drying with a particle-scale mechanical model, to capture the two-way coupling between the evolving drying pattern and solid particle displacements.Our simulations show that for a low pore-size disorder, and low confining stress, matrix deformations are favorable and lead to preferential drying patterns which maintain high drying rates. This effect is observed throughout the drying process when the disorder is low, but disappears after breakthrough for low confining stress, indicating a different mechanism by which deformation can impact drying. These results could be significant for various industrial applications, including fabrication of advanced nano-materials, where patterned drying can be used to obtain the desired structure."},

The increasing atmospheric CO2 provides a basis for CO2 injection into a deep saline aquifer. Saline aquifer formation, commonly found in sedimentary basin, occurs naturally as layers of distinguishable depositional facies. Many previous studies on convective instability in heterogeneous porous system are based on random and regular variation of permeability. The effect of a layered permeability heterogeneity on the onset of convective instability has been considered with a steady base profile. However, the role of a layered permeability heterogeneity on the onset of convective instability with diffusive base profile has not received much attention. This study on density driven convective instability is based on Linear stability analysis with quasi-steady state approximation. Finite difference numerical framework is adopted to handle the stepwise change in the permeability field.

The uniform dissolution extensively homogenizes the medium and therefore the flow field. The homogenization is further enhanced when the surface reaction is transport controlled\u2014when slow diffusion of dissolved ions away from the mineral surface leads to the reduction of the global dissolution rate. Under those conditions, diffusive transport is more effective in narrow channels, which selectively enlarge, leading to an initial steep rise of the permeability. However, as dissolution proceeds, the void space widens and the overall dissolution rate drops, and permeability enhancement slows down. Finally, we review the relevance of these results to various processes in geological systems ranging from diagenesis and karst evolution, to carbon geosequestration.

Here, we perform an objective comparison of a variety of state-of-the-art pore-scale models, including lattice Boltzmann, stochastic rotation dynamics, volume-of-fluid, level-set, phase-field, and pore-network models. As the basis for this comparison, we use a dataset from recent microfluidic experiments with precisely controlled pore geometry and wettability conditions, which offers an unprecedented benchmarking opportunity. We compare the results of the 14 participating teams both qualitatively and quantitatively using several standard metrics, such as fractal dimension, finger width, and displacement efficiency.

We perform pore-network simulations with varying flow rates and different degrees of spatial correlation, complemented with microfluidic experiments. Simulated and experimental displacement patterns show that spatial correlation leads to more preferential invasion, with reduced trapping of the defending fluid, especially at low flow rates. Numerically, we find that increasing the correlation length reduces the fluid-fluid interfacial area and the trapping of the defending fluid, and increases the invasion pattern asymmetry and selectivity.

We also consider this problem numerically, using a model of invasion percolation with trapping, and find that there is a crossover in invasion behavior associated with the length scale of the disorder in the system. The critical exponents that describe large enough events are similar to the classic invasion percolation problem, while the addition of a finite correlation length significantly affects the exponent values of avalanches and bursts, up to some characteristic size.

The DSW produced at the Hadera seawater reverse-osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant is recharged into the aquifer through an infiltration pond at the managed aquifer recharge (MAR) site of Menashe, Israel. The distinct difference in isotope composition between DSW (\u03b418OD1.41 \u2030; \u03b42HD11.34 \u2030) and the natural groundwater (\u03b418OD-4.48\u2030 to-5.43 \u2030; \u03b42HD-18.41\u2030 to-22.68 \u2030) makes the water isotopes preferable for use as a tracer compared to widely used chemical tracers, such as chloride. Moreover, this distinct difference can be used to simplify the system to a binary mixture of two end-members: desalinated seawater and groundwater. This approach is validated through a sensitivity analysis, and it is especially robust when spatial data of stable water isotopes in the aquifer are scarce. A calibrated groundwater flow and transport model was used to predict the DSW plume distribution in the aquifer after 50 years of MAR with DSW.

We use a novel, mechanistic pore-scale model to simulate flooding of a sample under fixed confining stress. Our simulations show that increasing the stress inhibits the permeability enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) outlet region. As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability. Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high Damkohler number, Da), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding, the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution\u2014characteristic of wormholing\u2014becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the impact of stress at breakthrough. In contrast, at high flow rates (low Da), incomplete reaction upstream allows some of the reactant to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction at the outlet provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the impact of stress is more pronounced at high Da during early stages (low permeability), and at low Da close breakthrough. Our work promotes understanding of the interplay between dissolution and compaction and its effect on the hydromechanical property evolution, with important implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to well stimulation and carbon sequestration."},

This paper addresses an additional dispersion mechanism which is induced by gravitational settling and is a result of the coupling between the particle concentration and the fluid velocity profiles at the sub-scale. Heavy particles that move in areas of low horizontal velocity (e.g., near solid surfaces and wake regions) settle closer to the release source as compared to particles in high velocity regions. The macroscopic concentration field of such suspensions is influenced by the ratio between the settling velocity and the sub-scale distribution of the horizontal velocities. The objective of the study is to isolate and quantify this type of dispersion using controlled flow scenarios. We used a Taylor brush geometry (an array of vertical grooves) to numerically solve the flow. Particles were released from a vertical plane, generating a constant flux. The sub-scale Eulerian concentration was compiled from simulated trajectories and then spatially averaged to generate macroscopic concentration fields. The results show that this settling-induced dispersion is significant in regions near the source and that it cannot be modeled using Fick's law type of formulations. A parametric investigation shows that the location of the highest dispersion flux is linearly proportional to both the groove spacing and depth. A proposed model that estimates this location is used to evaluate where settling-induced dispersion should not be ignored."},

A recently proposed scaling theory for vegetation growth appeals to the tortuosity of optimal paths from percolation theory to define the spatio\u2010temporal scaling of the root radial extent (or, equivalently, plant height). Root radial extent measures the maximum horizontal distance between a plant shoot and the root tips. We apply here the same scaling relationship to unsteady (horizontal) flow associated with plant transpiration. The pore\u2010scale travel time is generated from the maximum flow rate under saturated conditions and a typical pore size. At the field\u2010scale, the characteristic time is interpreted as the growing season duration, and the characteristic length is derived from the measured evapotranspiration in that period. We show that the two scaling results are equivalent, and they are each in accord with observed vegetation growth limits, as well as with actual limiting transpiration values. While the conceptual approach addresses transpiration, most accessed data are for evapotranspiration. The equivalence of the two scaling approaches suggests that, if horizontal flow is the dominant pathway in plant transpiration, horizontal unsteady flow follows the same scaling relationship as root growth. Then, we propose a corresponding scaling relationship to vertical infiltration, a hypothesis which is amenable to testing using infiltration results of Sharma and co\u2010authors. This alternate treatment of unsteady vertical flow may be an effective alternative to the commonly applied method based on the diffusion of water over a continuum as governed by Richards\u2019 equation."},

Special focus is given to the definition and symmetry of the dispersion tensor that is controlling how a solute plume spreads out. We show that the dispersion tensor is not symmetric and that the asymmetry derives from the advective derivative in the pore-scale advection-diffusion equation. When flow is spatially variable across a voxel, such as in the presence of a permeability gradient, the amount of asymmetry can be large. As first shown by Auriault [J.-L. Auriault et al. Transp. Porous Med. 85, 771 (2010)] in the limit of low P\u00e9clet number, we show that at any P\u00e9clet number, the dispersion tensor Dij\u00a0satisfies the flow-reversal symmetryDij (+q) =\u00a0Dji\u00a0(-q)\u00a0where\u00a0q\u00a0is the mean flow in the voxel under analysis; however, Reynold's number must be sufficiently small that the flow is reversible when the force driving the flow changes sign. We also demonstrate these symmetries using lattice-Boltzmann simulations and discuss some subtle aspects of how to measure the dispersion tensor numerically. In particular, the numerical experiments demonstrate that the off-diagonal components of the dispersion tensor are antisymmetric which is consistent with the analytical dependence on the average flow gradients that we propose for these off-diagonal components."},

During a month (January 2015) of continuous intensive MAR (2.45\u2009\u00d7\u2009106m3 discharged to a 10.7ha area), groundwater level has risen by 17m attaining full connection with the pond, while average infiltration rates declined by almost 2 orders of magnitude (from \u2009\u223c\u200911 to \u2009\u223c\u20090.4md\u22121).

It was found that a calibrated numerical model with a one-dimensional representative sediment profile is able to capture MAR dynamics, including temporal reduction of infiltration rates, drainage and groundwater recharge. Measured infiltration rates of an independent MAR event (January 2016) fitted well to those calculated by the calibrated numerical model, showing the model validity.

We show that the frequently\u2010made assumption of linear\u2010elastic cement and intergranular contact area which varies according to a Hertzian\u2010type model cannot explain the observed nonlinearity of the bulk response. We introduce the micromechanical effect of mechanisms such as closure and opening of microcracks, granular cement and material heterogeneity through an effective contact stiffness which depends on the local deformation. We find that an exponential dependence between the effective stiffness and the local deformation, with a high exponent value, provides bulk stiffness which is in good agreement with experimental data. The inability of models with weaker intergranular stiffness\u2010deformation dependence to reproduce the experimental data demonstrates the highly\u2010nonlinear nature of the intergranular deformation. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for grain\u2010scale mechanisms in modeling granular materials, and provide a plausible explanation for the nonlinear behavior of weakly\u2010cemented sediments."},

Here, we investigate the pressure evolution during thermally\u2010induced dissociation, by means of a pore\u2010scale model that couples dissociation kinetics, multiphase flow and geomechanics. Dissociation is controlled by a self\u2010preservation mechanism: increasing pore pressure reduces the driving force for dissociation. Hence, the overpressure is constrained by the phase equilibrium pressure, regardless of the kinetic rate of dissociation, heat supply, and sediment permeability. Furthermore, we find that the timescale for buildup of pressure by dissociation is typically much larger than that for its dissipation by drainage. Consequently, the overpressure is controlled by the capillary entry thresholds, which depend on the mode of gas invasion. In low\u2010permeability systems, fracturing is the preferred mechanism, occurring at capillary pressures lower than the entry thresholds in the undeformed sediment. Our results suggest that while large overpressures cannot be sustained by rapid dissociation in natural systems, dissociation can induce important geomechanical effects. Gas migration by fracturing provides a possible link between dissociation, sediment deformation and methane venting."},

If sediment failure occurs, seafloor subsidence and landslides can severely damage offshore infrastructure.To evaluate the mechanical properties of a sediment sample, we simulate loading of a disordered pack of spherical grains by incremental displacements of its boundaries.

Using water quality data, mass-balance calculations, and actual flow-rate measurements, possible management scenarios for the Lower Jordan River and their potential affects on its salinity are investigated. The predicted scenarios reveal that implementation of some elements of the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty will have negative effects on the Jordan River water salinity. It is predicted that removal of sewage effluents dumped into the river (\u223c13 MCM/a) will significantly reduce the river water\u2019s flow and increase the relative proportion of the saline groundwater flux into the river. Under this scenario, the Cl content of the river at its southern point (Abdalla Bridge) will rise to almost 7000 mg/L during the summer. In contrast, removal of all the saline water (16.5 MCM/a) that is artificially discharged into the Lower Jordan River will significantly reduce its Cl concentration, to levels of 650\u20132600 and 3000\u20133500 mg/L in the northern and southern areas of the Lower Jordan River, respectively. However, because the removal of either the sewage effluents or the saline water will decrease the river\u2019s discharge to a level that could potentially cause river desiccation during the summer months, other water sources must be allocated to preserve in-stream flow needs and hence the river\u2019s ecosystem."},

It is based on the assumption of radial steady-state flow.  Besides times series of historical injection pressures and rates, rigorous implementation of Hall\u2019s method requires information about the ambient reservoir pressure.  In addition, it is assumed that the influence domain radius is constant during the observation period.  Neither of these parameters can be measured directly.This paper discusses a new method called slope analysis.  It is based on analysis of the variations of the slope of the plot of the time integral of pressures versus cumulative injection volume.  In particular, it produces an estimate of an apparent average reservoir pressure.  This method requires only injection pressures and rates data, which are routinely collected in the course of a waterflood.  Thus, slope analysis requires no interruption of regular field operations.The method has been verified with numerically generated pressure and rate data, and tested with field data.  In both cases it proved to be accurate, efficient and simple.  The estimated ambient reservoir pressure can be used to correct the Hall plot analysis or to map the average reservoir pressure over several patterns or an entire waterflood project.  Such maps can then be used to develop an efficient waterflood policy, which will help to arrest subsidence and improve oil recovery."},

The diversion of its major natural sources reduced its flow rate and led to drying events during the drought years of 2000 and 2001. Under these conditions of low flow rates, the potential influence of external sources on the river discharge and chemical composition became significant. Our measurements show that the concentrations of chloride, calcium, and sodium in the river water decrease along the first 20-km section, while sulfate and magnesium concentrations increase. These variations were addressed by a recent geochemical study, suggesting that ground water inflow plays a major role. To further examine the role of ground water, we applied mass-balance calculations, using detailed flow rate measurements, water samplings, and chemical analyses along the northern (upstream) part of the river. Our flow-rate measurements showed that the river base-flow during 2000 and 2001 was 500 to 1100 L s\u22121, which is about 40 times lower than the historical flow rates. Our measurements and calculations indicate that ground water input was 20 to 80% of the river water flow, and 20 to 50% of its solute mass flow. This study independently identifies the composition of possible end-members. These end-members contain high sulfate concentration and have similar chemical characteristics as were found in agricultural drains and in the \u201csaline\u201d Yarmouk River. Future regional development plans that include the river flow rate and chemistry should consider the interactions between the river and its shallow ground water system."},

This paper investigates the sources and transformations of nitrogen compounds in the Lower Jordan River by applying a combination of physical, chemical, isotopic, and mathematical techniques. The source waters of the Lower Jordan River contain sewage, which contributes high ammonium loads to the river. Ammonium concentrations decrease from 20 to 0-5 mg N L(-1) along the first 20 km of the Lower Jordan River, while nitrate concentrations increase from nearly zero to 10-15 mg N L(-1), and delta(15)N (NO(3)) values increase from less than 5 per thousand to 15-20 per thousand. Our data analysis indicates that intensive nitrification occurs along the river, between 5 and 12 km from the Sea of Galilee, while further downstream nitrate concentration increases mostly due to an external subsurface water source that enters the river."},

In a single laboratory experiment, we apply a fixed heat flux, two different magnetic field strengths and one rotation rate, allowing us to chart a continuous path through Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection (RBC), two regimes of magnetoconvection, rotating convection and two regimes of rotating magnetoconvection, before finishing back at RBC. Dynamically rapid transitions are determined to exist between jump rope vortex states, thermoelectrically driven magnetoprecessional modes, mixed wall- and oscillatory-mode rotating convection and a novel magnetostrophic wall mode.

The dynamic behaviour is dominated by strong three-dimensional oscillations with a period length that corresponds to the turnover time. Our analysis reveals that the flow structure in the  \u0393=5  box corresponds in key features to the jump rope vortex structure, which has recently been discovered in a  \u0393=2  cylinder (Vogt et al., Proc.

Their approach to the lid or the bottom of the convection box causes a temporal deceleration of both the horizontal velocity at the respective boundary and the vertical velocity in the bulk, which in turn is reflected in Nusselt number oscillations. The cellular flow regime shows remarkable similarities to properties commonly attributed to turbulent superstructures."},

To isolate the jet damping process, we carry out a suite of direct numerical simulations of quasi-two-dimensional, horizontally periodic Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection with stress-free boundary conditions in the presence of an external, vertical magnetic field. Jets, punctuated by intermittent convective bursts, develop at Rayleigh numbers (Ra, ratio of buoyancy to diffusion) beyond 105 when the magnetic field is relatively weak. Five primary flow regimes are found by varying 103\u2264Ra\u22641010 and the Chandrasekhar number (Ch, ratio of Lorentz to viscosity) 0\u2264Ch\u2264106: (i) steady convection rolls, (ii) steady magneto-columns, (iii) unsteady to turbulent magneto-plumes, (iv) horizontally drifting magneto-plumes, and (v) jets with intermittent turbulent convective bursts. We parse the parameter space using transitions derived from the interaction parameter (N, ratio of Lorentz to inertia). The transition to the regime dominated by jets has the most immediate applications to the magnetic damping of Jovian jet flows, where the separation between jets and a magnetically constrained system occurs at a jet-based interaction parameter value of NJ\u22481. We approximate the value of the Jovian interaction parameter as a function of depth, and find that the jets may brake at \u22486000 km below the surface, which is deeper than recent estimates from NASA's Juno mission.

In a cylindrical volume of liquid gallium heated from below and cooled from above and subject to a vertical magnetic field, it is found that the large scale circulation (LSC) can undergo a slow axial precession. Our experiments demonstrate that this LSC precession occurs only when electrically conducting boundary conditions are employed, and that the precession direction reverses when the axial magnetic field direction is flipped. A thermoelectric magnetoconvection (TEMC) model is developed that successfully predicts the zeroth-order magnetoprecession dynamics. Our TEMC magnetoprecession model hinges on thermoelectric current loops at the top and bottom boundaries, which create Lorentz forces that generate horizontal torques on the overturning large-scale circulatory flow. The thermoelectric torques in our model act to drive a precessional motion of the LSC. This model yields precession frequency predictions that are in good agreement with the experimental observations. We postulate that thermoelectric effects in convective flows, long argued to be relevant in liquid metal heat transfer and mixing processes, may also have applications in planetary interior magnetohydrodynamics."},

This allows us to study the oscillatory convective modes, sidewall modes and broadband turbulent flow that develop in liquid metals before the advent of steady columnar modes. Our thermo-velocimetric measurements show that strongly inertial, thermal wind flows develop, with velocities reaching those of non-rotating cases. Oscillatory bulk convection and wall modes coexist across a wide range of our experiments, along with strong zonal flows that peak in the Stewartson layer, but that extend deep into the fluid bulk in the higher supercriticality cases. The flows contain significant time-mean helicity that is anti-symmetric across the midplane, demonstrating that oscillatory liquid metal convection contains the kinematic components to sustain system-scale dynamo generation."},

We present a suite of C$^3$ direct numerical simulations, analysing the influence of centrifugal buoyancy on the formation of tornado-like vortices (TLVs). TLVs are self-consistently generated provided the flow is within the quasi-cyclostrophic (QC) regime in which the dominant dynamical balance is between pressure gradient and centrifugal buoyancy forces.This requires the Froude number to be greater than the radius-to-height aspect ratio, $Fr \\gtrsim \\gamma$. We show that the TLVs that develop in our C$^3$ simulations share many similar features with realistic tornadoes, such as azimuthal velocity profiles, intensification of the vortex strength, and helicity characteristics. Further, we analyse the influence of the mechanical bottom boundary conditions on the formation of TLVs, finding that a rotating fluid column above a stationary surface does not generate TLVs if centrifugal buoyancy is absent. In contrast, TLVs are generated in the QC regime with any bottom boundary conditions when centrifugal buoyancy is present. %Our simulations bring forth insights into natural supercell thunderstorm systems by identifying properties that determine whether a mesocyclone becomes tornadic or remains non-tornadic. For tornadoes to exist, a vertical temperature difference must be present that is capable of driving strong convection. Additionally, our $Fr \\gtrsim \\gamma$ predictions dimensionally imply a critical mesocyclone angular rotation rate of $\\widetilde{\\Omega},_{mc}, \\gtrsim \\sqrt{g/H_{mc},},$.

Two perspectives are considered, one where turbulent convection is viewed from the standpoint of an applied temperature drop across the domain and the other with a viewpoint in terms of an applied heat flux. While a straightforward transformation exists between the two perspectives, indicating equivalence, it is found the former provides a clear set of connections that bridge between the three regimes. Our generic convection scalings, based upon an inertial-Archimedean balance, produce the classic diffusion-free scalings for the nonrotating limit and the slowly rotating limit. This is characterized by a free-falling fluid parcel on the global scale possessing a thermal anomaly on par with the temperature drop across the domain. In the rapidly rotating limit, the generic convection scalings are based on a Coriolis-inertial-Archimedean (CIA) balance, along with a local fluctuating-mean advective temperature balance. This produces a scenario in which anisotropic fluid parcels attain a thermal wind velocity and where the thermal anomalies are greatly attenuated compared to the total temperature drop. We find that turbulent scalings may be deduced simply by consideration of the generic nondimensional transport parameters - local Reynolds Re\u2113=U\u2113/\u03bd; local P\u00e9clet Pe\u2113=U\u2113/\u03ba; and Nusselt number Nu=U\u03d1/(\u03ba\u0394T/H) - through the selection of physically relevant estimates for length \u2113, velocity U, and temperature scales \u03d1 in each regime. Emergent from the scaling analyses is a unified continuum based on a single external control parameter, the convective Rossby number, RoC=g\u03b1\u0394T/4\u03c92H, that strikingly appears in each regime by consideration of the local, convection-scale Rossby number Ro\u2113=U/(2\u03c9\u2113). Thus we show that RoC scales with the local Rossby number Ro\u2113 in both the slowly rotating and the rapidly rotating regimes, explaining the ubiquity of RoC in rotating convection studies. We show in non-, slowly, and rapidly rotating systems that the convective heat transport, parametrized via Pe\u2113, scales with the total heat transport parameterized via the Nusselt number Nu. Within the rapidly rotating limit, momentum transport arguments generate a scaling for the system-scale Rossby number, RoH, that, recast in terms of the total heat flux through the system, is shown to be synonymous with the classical flux-based CIA scaling, RoCIA. These, in turn, are then shown to asymptote to RoH\u223cRoCIA\u223cRoC2, demonstrating that these momentum transport scalings are identical in the limit of rapidly rotating turbulent heat transfer."},

We especially focus on the spatial distribution of the temperature field. Unlike idealized Coriolis convection in which centrifugal buoyancy is neglected, the vertical temperature profiles become strongly radially dependent and exhibit a top-bottom asymmetry with increasing Froude number. In the quasicyclostrophic regime the temperature in the center of the fluid volume shows a strong enhancement, reaching values close to the bottom boundary temperature, whereas the temperatures at the sidewall are well below the arithmetic mean.

The transition to centrifugally dominated dynamics occurs when the Froude number Fr equals the radius-to-height aspect ratio \u03b3. Hence, turbulentconvection experiments with small \u03b3 may encounter centrifugal effects at lower Fr than traditionally expected. Further, we show analytically that the direct effect of centrifugal buoyancy yields a reduction of the Nusselt number Nu. However, indirectly, it can cause a simultaneous increase of the viscous dissipationand thereby Nu through a change of the flow morphology. These direct and indirect effects yield a net Nu suppression in the CC regime and a net Nu enhancement in the QC regime.

The Ekman number varies from E ' 5 \u00d7 10\u22126to 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 and the Rayleigh number varies from Ra ' 2 \u00d7 105 to 1.5 \u00d7 107Using spectral analysis stemming from point-wise temperature measurements within the fluid and measurements of the Nusselt number Nu, we characterise the different styles of low-Pr rotating convective flow. The convection threshold is first overcome in the form of container-scale inertial oscillatory modes. At stronger forcing, sidewall-attached modes are identified for the first time in liquid metal laboratory experiments. These wall modes coexist with the bulk oscillatory modes.

Lett. 114, 114302 (2015)], the thermal BL equation with the fluctuations taken into account as an eddy thermal diffusivity has been solved for large Prandtl-number fluids for which the eddy thermal diffusivity and the velocity field can be approximated, respectively, as a cubic and a linear function of the distance from the plate. In the present work, we make use of the idea of Prandtl's mixing length model and relate the eddy thermal diffusivity to the stream function. With this proposed relation, we can solve the thermal BL equation and obtain a closed-form expression for the dimensionless mean temperature profile in terms of two independent parameters for fluids with a general Prandtl number. With a proper choice of the parameters, our predictions of the temperature profiles are in excellent agreement with the results of our direct numerical simulations for a wide range of Prandtl numbers from 0.01 to 2547.9 and Rayleigh numbers from 107 to 109."},

Here we present results from direct numerical simulations of three representative setups: First, a fluid with Pr \u201c 6.4, corresponding to water, in a cylinder with a diameter-to-height aspect ratio of \u0393 \u201c 2, secondly, a fluid with Pr \u201c 0.8, corresponding to SF6 or air, confined in a slender cylinder with \u0393 \u201c 0.5, and thirdly, the main focus of this paper, a fluid with Pr \u201c 0.025, corresponding to a liquid metal, in a cylinder with \u0393 \u201c 1.87. The obtained flow fields are analysed using the sparsity-promoting variant of the dynamic mode decomposition(DMD). By means of this technique, we extract the coherent structures that govern the dynamics of the flow, as well as their associated frequencies. In addition, we follow the temporal evolution of single modes and present a criterion to identify their direction of travel, i.e. whether they are precessing prograde or retrograde. We show that for moderate Pr a few dynamic modes suffice to accurately describe the flow. For large aspect ratios, these are wall-localised waves that travel retrograde along the periphery of the cylinder. Their DMD frequencies agree with the predictions of linear stability theory. With increasing Rayleigh number Ra, the interior gradually fills with columnar vortices, and eventually a regular pattern of convective Taylor columnsprevails. For small aspect ratios and close enough to onset, the dominant flow structures are body modes that can precess either prograde or retrograde. For Pr \u201c 0.8, DMD additionally unveiled the existence of so far unobserved low-amplitude oscillatory modes. Furthermore, we elucidate the multi-modal character of oscillatory convection in low Prandtl number fluids. Generally, more dynamic modes must be retained to accurately approximate the flow. Close to onset, the flow is purely oscillatory and the DMD reveals that these high-frequency modes are a superposition of oscillatory columns and cylinderscale inertial waves. We find that there are co-existing prograde and retrograde modes, as well as quasi-axisymmetric torsional modes. For higher Ra, the flow also becomes unstable to wall modes. These low-frequency modes can both co-exist with the oscillatory modes, and also couple to them. However, the typical flow feature of rotating convection at moderate Pr , the quasi-steady Taylor vortices, is entirely absent in low Pr flows."},

Coronary vasodilation and the physiological mechanisms involved in exercise have frequently been the focus of numerical models for simulating exercise. This is partly achieved using the time-varying-elastance (TVE) theory, which prescribes the pressure-volume relationship of the ventricle as a periodic function of time, tuned using empirical data. The empirical foundations of the TVE method however, and its suitability for CVS modelling are frequently questioned. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a different synergistic approach in which a model for the microscale heart muscle (myofibers) activity is embedded within a macro organ-scale CVS model. We developed such a synergistic model by including the coronary flow and various control mechanisms at the circulation level through feedback and feedforward means, and at the microscale (contractile) through the regulation of ATP availability and myofiber force depending on exercise intensity or heart rate. The coronary flow produced by the model displays the well-known 2-phase character of the flow, which is preserved under exercise. The model is tested by simulating reactive hyperemia, which is a transient occlusion of the coronary flow, successfully reproducing the additional coronary flow following the block removal. On-transient exercise results reveal a rise in both cardiac output and mean ventricle pressure as expected. The stroke volume increases initially, but then declines during the latter period of HR rise, corresponding with one of the main physiological responses to exercise. The pressure-volume loop expands during exercise, as systolic pressure rises. The Myocardial oxygen demand increases during exercise and the coronary blood supply increases in response, causing an excess of oxygen supply to the heart. Off-transient exercise recovery is largely a reverse of this response, although the behaviour is slightly more varied, with sudden spikes in coronary resistance. Different levels of fitness and exercise intensity are tested and reveal that the stroke volume rises until a level of myocardial oxygen demand is reached at which point it declines. This level of demand is independent of fitness or exercise intensity. An advantage of our model is demonstrated in the correspondence between the micro and organ scale mechanics so that cellular pathologies can be traced from exercise performance with relatively little computational or experimental expense."},

We calculate exact time-dependent PDFs by numerically solving the Fokker\u2013Planck equation and characterize time-varying statistical properties of ELMs for different energy fluxes and noise amplitudes. The stochastic noise is shown to introduce phase-mixing and plays a significant role in mitigating extreme bursts of large ELMs. Furthermore, based on time-dependent PDFs, we provide a path-dependent information geometric theory of the ELM dynamics and demonstrate its utility in capturing self-regulatory relaxation oscillations, bursts and a sudden change in the system."},

The two most widely used methods for measuring causality are Granger Causality (GC) and Transfer Entropy (TE), which rely on measuring the improvement in the prediction of one process based on the knowledge of another process at an earlier time. However, they have their own limitations, e.g., in applications to nonlinear, non-stationary data, or non-parametric models. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to quantify causality through information geometry that overcomes such limitations. Specifically, based on the information rate that measures the rate of change of the time-dependent distribution, we develop a model-free approach called information rate causality that captures the occurrence of the causality based on the change in the distribution of one process caused by another. This measurement is suitable for analyzing numerically generated non-stationary, nonlinear data. The latter are generated by simulating different types of discrete autoregressive models which contain linear and nonlinear interactions in unidirectional and bidirectional time-series signals. Our results show that information rate causality can capture the coupling of both linear and nonlinear data better than GC and TE in the several examples explored in the paper."},

To overcome this challenge, we propose a synergistic model of left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) by self-consistently integrating various feedback mechanisms among the electro-mechanical and chemical functions of the micro-scale myofiber, the macro-scale dynamics of the LA and LV, the atrioventricular node (AV), andcirculation. The model is tested and shown to reproduce the essential features of the atrium cycling, such as the characteristic figure of eight pressure\u2013volume loops. Our model is further developed to investigate the effect of dysfunctions of the mechanical-electric feedback (MEF) in the atrium. Our model not only successfully reproduces key experimental MEF observations such as prolonged action-potential and increases in action-potential magnitude induced by atrial stretch but also shows how MEF and arrhythmia of the atrium lead to a degradation of cardiac output and pumping power with significant consequences. In particular, MEF reproduces arrhythmia such as ectopic and erratic cycling, missed heart beats and restricted function."},

The oscillation quenching occurs due to either stochastic particle or magnetic perturbations, although particle perturbation is more effective inthis amplitude diminishment compared with magnetic perturbations. On the other hand, magnetic perturbations are more effective at altering the oscillation period; the stochastic noise acts to increase the frequency of explosive oscillations (large ELMs) while decreasing the frequency of more regular oscillations (small ELMs). These stochastic noises significantly reduce power and energy losses caused by ELMs and play a key role in reproducing the observed experimental scaling relationof the ELM power loss with the input power. Furthermore, the maximum power loss is closely linked to the maximum entropy production rate, involving irreversible energy dissipation in nonequilibrium. Notably, over one ELM cycle, the information rate appears to keep almost a constant value, indicative of a geodesic. The information rate is also shown to be useful for characterising the statistical properties of ELMs, such as distinguishing between explosive and regular oscillations and the regulation between the pressure gradient and magnetic fluctuations."},

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a promising technique in the time domain, but it is sensitive to the initial conditions of the state and error covariance matrices. In the case of integer-order systems, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can tackle EKF\u2019s sensitiveness issues. The algorithm usually uses EAs to optimise the initial conditions for the EK, leading to a better estimate of the system parameters and states. Here, we extend this methodology to fractional-order models to estimate the model\u2019s fractional order and parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology on a simple mechanical model."},

Then, we propose the application of entropy rate and entropy production to different practical applications such as abrupt event detection, correlation analysis, and control engineering. Specifically, by utilising the Fokker-Planck equation of multi-variable linear stochastic processes described by Langevin equations, we calculate the exact value for information rate, entropy rate, and entropy production and derive various inequalities among them. Inspired by classical correlation coefficients and control techniques, we create entropic-informed correlation coefficients as abrupt event detection methods and information geometric cost functions as optimal thermodynamic control policies, respectively. The methods are analysed via the numerical simulations of common prototypical systems."},

Here, we investigate the effects of variations in the opening and closing times of the valves of the left ventricle at the same time as pathologies in the mechano-electric feedback. To this end, we utilize our synergistic cardio-vascular model without having to use time-varying elastance method. The latter prescribes the pressure-volume relationship in the ventricle directly using a periodic function, neglecting cardiac feedback and regulating mechanisms and is therefore unsuitable for investigating the mechano-electric feedback. We find that the closing time of valves has the greatest effect. A slower closing period of the aortic valve delays the onset of complications caused by the mechano-electric feedback, reducing the susceptibility to systolic stretch. For diastolic stretch, slow mitral valve closing time drastically increases the rise in heartrate and lessens the decline in stroke volume."},

The model concerns the regulation of turbulence by zonal and mean flow shear. Independent delta-correlated Gaussian stochastic noises are used to construct Langevin equations for the amplitudes of turbulence and zonal flow shear. We then find numerical solutions of the equivalent Fokker\u2013Planck equation for the time- dependent joint probability distribution of these quantities. We extend the earlier studies [Kim and Hollerbach, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023077 (2020) and Hollerbach et al., Phys. Plasmas 27, 102301 (2020)] by applying different functional forms of the time-dependent external heating (input power), which is increased and then decreased in a symmetric fashion to study hysteresis. The hysteresis is examined through the probability distribution and statistical measures, which include information geometry and entropy. We find strongly non-Gaussian probabil- ity distributions with bimodality being a persistent feature across the input powers; the information length to be a better indicator of dis- tance to equilibrium than the total entropy. Both dithering transitions and direct L-\u2013H transitions are (also) seen when the input power is stepped in time. By increasing the number of steps, we see less hysteresis (in the statistical measures) and a reduced probability of H-mode access; intermittent zonal flow shear is seen to have a role in the initial suppression of turbulence by zonal flow shear and stronger excitation of intermittent zonal flow shear for a faster changing input power."},

Disorders in the valves of the left ventricle are a prominent example of heart disease, with prolapse, regurgitation, and stenoses\u2014the three main valve disorders. It is widely known that mitral valve prolapse increases the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we investigate stenoses and regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves in the left ventricle using a synergistic low-order numerical model. The model synergy derives from the incorporation of the mechanical, chemical, and electrical elements. As an alternative framework to the time-varying elastance (TVE) method, it allows feedback mechanisms at work in the heart to be considered. The TVE model imposes the ventricular pressure\u2013volume relationship using a periodic function rather than calculating it consistently. Using our synergistic approach, the effects of valve disorders on the mechano-electric-feedback (MEF) are investigated. The MEF is the influence of cellular mechanics on the electrical activity, and significantly contributes to the generation of arrhythmia. We further investigate stenoses and regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves and their relationship with the MEF and generation of arrhythmia. Mitral valve stenosis is found to increase the sensitivity to arrhythmia-stimulating systolic stretch, and reduces the sensitivity to diastolic stretch. Aortic valve stenosis does not change the sensitivity to arrhythmia-stimulating stretch, and regurgitation reduces it. A key result is found when valve regurgitation is accompanied by diastolic stretch. In the presence of MEF disorder, ectopic beats become far more frequent when accompanied by valve regurgitation. Therefore, arrhythmia resulting from a disorder in the MEF will be more severe when valve regurgitation is present."},

This is done through a focus on innovations to provide solutions for high performance long pulse operation, coupled with fundamental plasma physics understanding and model validation, to drive scenario development by integrating high performance core and boundary plasmas. Substantial increases in off-axis current drive efficiency from an innovative top launch system for EC power, and in pressure broadening for Alfven eigenmode control from a co-/counter-Ip steerable off-axis neutral beam, all improve the prospects for optimization of future long pulse/steady state high performance tokamak operation. Fundamental studies into the modes that drive the evolution of the pedestal pressure profile and electron vs ion heat flux validate predictive models of pedestal recovery after ELMs. Understanding the physics mechanisms of ELM control and density pumpout by 3D magnetic perturbation fields leads to confident predictions for ITER and future devices. Validated modeling of high-Z shattered pellet injection for disruption mitigation, runaway electron dissipation, and techniques for disruption prediction and avoidance including machine learning, give confidence in handling disruptivity for future devices. For the non-nuclear phase of ITER, two actuators are identified to lower the L\u2013H threshold power in hydrogen plasmas. With this physics understanding and suite of capabilities, a high poloidal beta optimized-core scenario with an internal transport barrier that projects nearly to Q = 10 in ITER at \u223c8 MA was coupled to a detached divertor, and a near super H-mode optimized-pedestal scenario with co-Ip beam injection was coupled to a radiative divertor. The hybrid core scenario was achieved directly, without the need for anomalous current diffusion, using off-axis current drive actuators. Also, a controller to assess proximity to stability limits and regulate \u03b2N in the ITER baseline scenario, based on plasma response to probing 3D fields, was demonstrated. Finally, innovative tokamak operation using a negative triangularity shape showed many attractive features for future pilot plant operation."},

In contrast to these models, however, by allowing the same phenotypic value to be produced via two different paths, i.e. deterministic, genic, vs stochastic, epigenetic mechanisms, we demonstrate when genic contributions alone cannot produce an optimal phenotype, plastic, epigenetic contributions will instead fully accommodate new environments, allowing for both adaptive and non-adaptive plasticity to evolve. Furthermore, we show that while rates of phenotypic accommodation are relatively constant under a wide range of selective conditions, selection will favor the most efficient route to adaptation: deterministic, genic response, or stochastic, plastic response. As a result, plasticity may evolve or canalization may occur within a given epoch depending on the relative mutation rate of genic and epigenetic contributions to phenotype, highlighting the importance of genetic conflict on the evolution of plasticity."},

By utilising an asymmetric sawtooth periodic potential and three different types of periodic forcing G(t) (sinusoidal, square and sawtooth waves) with period T and amplitude A, we investigate the performance (energetics, mean current, Stokes efficiency) of a rocking ratchet in light of thermodynamic quantities (entropy production) and the path-dependent information geometric measures. For each G(t), we calculate exact time-dependent probability density functions under different conditions by varying T, A and the strength of the stochastic noise D in an unprecedentedly wide range. Overall similar behaviours are found for different cases of G(t). In particular, in all cases, the current, Stokes efficiency and the information rate normalised by A and D exhibit one or multiple local maxima and minima as A increases. However, the dependence of the current and Stokes efficiency on A can be quite different, while the behaviour of the information rate normalised by A and D tends to resemble that of the Stokes efficiency. In comparison, the irreversibility measured by a normalised entropy production is independent of A. The results indicate the utility of the information geometry as a proxy of a motor efficiency."},

One of these mechanisms, the mechano-electric feedback (MEF), is the electrical response of the heart to local mechanical changes in the environment. This electrical response, in turn, leads to macroscopic changes in heart function. In this paper, we demonstrate that the MEF plays a crucial role in mechanical generation and recovery from arrhythmia which has been observed in experimental studies. To this end, we investigate the cardiac response to a mechanical stimulation using a minimal, multiscale model of the heart which couples the organ level dynamics (left ventricular pressure and volume) and contractile dynamics. By including a mechanical stimulation into the model as a (short, sudden) impulse in the muscle microscale stress, we investigate how the timing, amplitude and duration of the impulse affect the cardiac cycle. In particular, when introduced in the diastolic period of the cardiac cycle, the pulse rate can be stabilised, and ectopic beats and bifurcation can be eliminated, either temporarily or permanently. The stimulation amplitude is a key indicator to this response. We find an optimal value of the impulse amplitude above or below which the impulse maximises the stabilisation. As a result a dysfunction of the MEF can be helped using a mechanical stimulation, by allowing the heart to recover its pumping power. On the other hand, when the mechanical stimulation is introduced towards the end of systole, arrhythmia can be generated."},

While traditionally, mean values and variance have been heavily used, they are not appropriate in describing extreme events where a significant deviation from mean values often occurs. Furthermore, stationary Probability Density Functions (PDFs) miss crucial information about the dynamics associated with variability. It is thus critical to go beyond a traditional approach and deal with time-dependent PDFs. Here, we consider atmospheric data from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and calculate time-dependent PDFs and the information length from these PDFs, which is the total number of statistically different states that a system evolves through in time. Specifically, we consider the three cases of sampling data to investigate the distribution of information (information budget) along the altitude and longitude to gain a new perspective of understanding variabilities, correlation among different variables and regions. Time-dependent PDFs are shown to be non-Gaussian in general; the information length tends to increase with the altitude albeit in a complex form; this tendency is more robust for flows/shears than temperature. Much similarity among flows and shears in the information length is also found in comparison with the temperature. This means a strong correlation among flows/shears because of their coupling through gravity waves in this particular WACCM model. We also find the increase of the information length with the latitude and interesting hemispheric asymmetry for flows/shears/temperature, with the tendency of anti-correlation (correlation) between flows/shears and temperature at high (low) latitude. These results suggest the importance of high latitude/altitude in the information budget in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the spatial gradient of the information length being a useful proxy for information flow."},

Within the traditional time-varying elastance model, cardiac selforganization and breakdown cannot be addressed due to its inability to incorporate the dynamics of various feedback mechanisms consistently. To face this challenge, we recently proposed a paradigm shift from the time-varying elastance concept to a synergistic model of cardiac function by integrating mechanical, electric and chemical activity on micro-scale sarcomere and macro-scale heart. In this paper, by using our synergistic model, we investigate the mechano-electric feedback (MEF) which is the effect of mechanical activities on electric activity\u2014one of the important feedback loops in cardiac function. We show that the (dysfunction of) MEF leads to various forms of heart arrhythmias, for instance, causing the electric activity and left-ventricular volume and pressure to oscillate too fast, too slowly, or erratically through periodic doubling bifurcations or ectopic excitations of incommensurable frequencies. This can result in a pathological condition, reminiscent of dilated cardiomyopathy, where a heart cannot contract or relax properly, with an ineffective cardiac pumping and abnormal electric activities. This pathological condition is then shown to be improved by a heart assist device (an axial rotary pump) since the latter tends to increase the stroke volume and aortic pressure while inhibiting the progression (bifurcation) to such a pathological condition. These results highlight a nontrivial effect of a mechanical pump on the electric activity of the heart."},

Our model is based on the extension of the deterministic prey-predator-type model [Kim and Diamond, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 185006 (2003)] to a stochastic model by including two independent, short-correlated Gaussian noises. The \"forward\"process consists of ramping up the input power linearly in time so that zonal flows self-regulate with turbulence after their initial growth from turbulence. The \"backward\"process ramps the power down again, by starting at time t = t\u2217 when the input power is switched to Q (t) = Q (2 t\u2217 - t) for t > t*, linearly decreasing with time until t = 2 t*. Using three choices for Q(t), with differing ramping rates, the time-dependent PDFs are calculated by numerically solving the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation, and several statistical measures including the information length for the forward and backward processes are investigated. The information lengths L x (t) and L v (t) for turbulence and zonal flows, respectively, are path-dependent dimensionless numbers, representing the total number of statistically different states that turbulence and zonal flows evolve through in time t. In particular, PDFs are shown to be strongly non-Gaussian with convoluted structures and multiple peaks, with intermittency in zonal flows playing a key role in turbulence regulation. The stark difference between the forward and backward processes is captured by time-dependent PDFs of turbulence and zonal flows and the corresponding information length diagnostics. The latter are shown to give us a useful insight into understanding the correlation and self-regulation, and transition to the self-regulatory dithering phase."},

When discussing the behavior of such a system which is evolving in time, it is useful to have the notion of a metric between two given states. A popular measure of information change in a system under perturbation has been the relative entropy of the states, as this notion allows us to quantify the difference between states of a system at different times. In this paper, we investigate the relaxation problem given by a single and coupled Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (O-U) process and compare the information length with entropy-based metrics (relative entropy, Jensen divergence) as well as others. By measuring the total information length in the long time limit, we show that it is only the information length that preserves the linear geometry of the O-U process. In the coupled O-U process, the information length is shown to be capable of detecting changes in both components of the system even when other metrics would detect almost nothing in one of the components. We show in detail that the information length is sensitive to the evolution of subsystems."},

For initial positions close to the equilibrium point x = 0, the peaks largely maintain their shape while moving. In contrast, for initial positions sufficiently close to the unstable point x = 1, there is a tendency for the peak to slump in place and broaden considerably before reconstituting itself at the equilibrium point. A consequence of this is that the information length L\n              \u221e, the total number of statistically distinguishable states that the system evolves through, is smaller for initial positions closer to the unstable point than for more intermediate values.

The left ventricular pressure\u2013volume relation plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. Lumped-parameter models combined with pressure\u2013 volume loop analysis are very effective in simulating clinical scenarios with a view to treatment optimization and outcome prediction. Unfortunately, often invoked in this analysis is the traditional, time-varying elastance concept, in which the ratio of the ventricular pressure to its volume is prescribed by a periodic function of time, instead of being calculated consistently according to the change in feedback mechanisms (e.g., the lack or breakdown of self-organization) in heart diseases. Therefore, the application of the time-varying elastance for the analysis of left ventricular assist device (LVAD)\u2013heart interactions has been questioned. We propose a paradigm shift from the time-varying elastance concept to a synergistic model of cardiac function by integrating the mechanical, electric, and chemical activity on microscale sarcomere and macroscale heart levels and investigating the effect of an axial rotary pump on a failing heart. We show that our synergistic model works better than the time-varying elastance model in reproducing LVAD\u2013heart interactions with sufficient accuracy to describe the left ventricular pressure\u2013volume relation."},

A full knowledge of Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs), especially time-dependent PDFs, becomes essential in understanding far-from-equilibrium processes. We consider a stochastic logistic model with multiplicative noise, which has gamma distributions as stationary PDFs. We numerically solve the transient relaxation problem and show that as the strength of the stochastic noise increases, the time-dependent PDFs increasingly deviate from gamma distributions. For sufficiently strong noise, a transition occurs whereby the PDF never reaches a stationary state, but instead, forms a peak that becomes ever more narrowly concentrated at the origin. The addition of an arbitrarily small amount of additive noise regularizes these solutions and re-establishes the existence of stationary solutions. In addition to diagnostic quantities such as mean value, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis, the transitions between different solutions are analysed in terms of entropy and information length, the total number of statistically-distinguishable states that a system passes through in time."},

We calculate time-dependent probability density functions (PDFs) and the information length L, which is the total number of different states that a system undergoes during the transition. Time-dependent PDFs during transient relaxation exhibit strikingly different behavior in FPs and BPs. In particular, FPs driven by instability undergo the broadening of the PDF with a large increase in fluctuations before the transition to the ordered state accompanied by narrowing the PDF width. During this stage, we identify an interesting geodesic solution accompanied by the self-regulation between the growth and nonlinear damping where the time scale \u03c4 of information change is constant in time, independent of the strength of the stochastic noise. In comparison, BPs are mainly driven by the macroscopic motion due to the movement of the PDF peak. The total information length L between initial and final states is much larger in BPs than in FPs, increasing linearly with the deviation \u03b3 of a control parameter from the critical state in BPs while increasing logarithmically with \u03b3 in FPs. L scales as |lnD| and D-1/2 in FPs and BPs, respectively, where D measures the strength of the stochastic forcing. These differing scalings with \u03b3 and D suggest a great utility of L in capturing different underlying processes, specifically, diffusion vs advection in phase transition by geometry.

Explaining how this rotation of solar-type stars evolves in time is currently an interesting but difficult problem in astrophysics. Despite the complexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of angular momentum by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful framework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation, age, and magnetic field strength. Here, for the first time, a spindown model is proposed where loss of angular momentum by magnetic fields evolves dynamically, instead of being prescibed kinematically. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and magnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our previous work on a dynamo model which incorporates nonlinear feedback mechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. We show that our extended model reproduces key observations and is capable of explaining the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow rotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate \u03a9 versus time (age), magnetic field strength ?B? versus rotation rate, and frequency of magnetic field \u03c9cyc versus rotation rate. For fast rotating stars we find that: (i) there is an exponential spindown \u03a9 \u221d e-1.35t, with t measured in Gyr; (ii) magnetic activity saturates for higher rotation rate; (iii) \u03c9cyc \u221d \u03a90.83. For slow rotating stars we find: (i) a power-law spindown \u03a9 \u221d t-0.52; (ii) that magnetic activity scales roughly linearly with rotation rate; (iii) \u03c9cyc \u221d \u03a91.16. The results obtained from our investigations are in good agreement with observations. The Vaughan-Preston gap is consistently explained in our model by the shortest spindown timescale in this transition from fast to slow rotators. Our results highlight the importance of self-regulation of magnetic fields and rotation by direct and indirect interactions involving nonlinear feedback in stellar evolution."},

From this, we quantify the total change in information in terms of information length L and the associated action J, where L represents the distance that the system travels in the fluctuation-based, statistical metric space parameterized by time.

Using a function, Atanh(t/T) for the transition of input heating power for tokamak plasmas, i.e. the addition of the perturbation, Atanh(t/T), to constant power q0 is shown to promote the confinement, leading to the L\u2013H transition at a lower value of q0, as compared to the case of constant q0 without the Atanh(t/T) perturbation.

The large-scale flow is a shearing motion in either the radial or the latitudinal directions.

At the heart of homeostasis are various feedback loops, which can control and regulate a system to stay in a most favourable stable state upon the influence of various disturbance. While variability has emerged as a key factor in sustainability, too much variability could however be detrimental. It is thus absolutely crucial to understand the effect of fluctuation in different feedback loops. While modelling technique has achieved a great advancement to understand this issue, too a complicated model however often prevents us from disentangling different many processes.Here, we propose a novel model to gain a key insight into the effect of variability in feedback on self-sustained oscillation. Specifically, by taking into account variation in model parameters for self-excitation and nonlinear damping, corresponding to positive and negative feedback, respectively, we show how fluctuation in positive or negative feedback weakens the efficiency of feedback and affects self-sustained oscillations, possibly leading to a complete breakdown of self-regulation. While results are generic and could be applied to different self-regulating systems (e.g. self-regulation of neuron activity, normal cell growth, etc.), we present a specific application to heart dynamics. In particular, we show that fluctuation in positive feedback can lead to slow heart by either amplitude death or oscillation death pathway while fluctuation in negative feedback can lead to fast heart beat."},

We first present a linear stochastic differential model with finite auto-correlation time, where a randomly fluctuating growth rate with a negative average is shown to result in exponential growth for sufficiently large fluctuations in growth rate. We then present a non-linear stochastic selfregulation model where the loss of coherent self-regulation and an increase in noise can induce a shift from bounded to unbounded growth. An important consequence of these models is that while the average change in phenotype may not differ for various parameter sets, the variance of the resulting distributions may considerably change. This demonstrates the necessity of understanding the influence of variance and heterogeneity within seemingly identical clonal populations, while providing a mechanism for varying functional consequences of such heterogeneity. Our results highlight the importance of a paradigm shift from a deterministic to a probabilistic view of clonality in understanding selection as an optimization problem on noise-driven processes, resulting in a wide range of biological implications, from robustness to environmental stress to the development of drug resistance."},

We find that p and \u03c6 are controlled by both flux losses with no influence by \u03b1-quenching when there is no back reaction because of fluctuating differential rotation.

To address these questions, we characterized a transcriptional regulatory network for the metastasis suppressor Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). We previously showed that the transcription factor BACH1 is negatively regulated by RKIP and promotes breast cancer metastasis. Here we demonstrate that BACH1 acts in a double-negative (overall positive) feedback loop to inhibit RKIP transcription in breast cancer cells. BACH1 also negatively regulates its own transcription. Analysis of the BACH1 network reveals the existence of an inverse relationship between BACH1 and RKIP involving both monostable and bistable transitions that can potentially give rise to nongenetic variability. Single-cell analysis confirmed monostable and bistablelike behavior. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors or depletion of the polycomb repressor enhancer of zeste homolog 2 altered relative RKIP and BACH1 levels in a manner consistent with a prometastatic state. Together, our results suggest that the mutually repressive relationship between metastatic regulators such as RKIP and BACH1 can play a key role in determining metastatic progression in cancer."},

In this paper the suppression of turbulent transport by large-scale flows is studied numerically by measuring the turbulent diffusion D t and scalar amplitude n\u2032 2 of decaying passive scalar fields n\u2032 advected by various turbulent flows. Both uniform flows and shear flows are shown to suppress turbulence causing the quenching in transport and turbulence amplitude. The uniform flows U0 = \u03bby with the advection rate in the case of a finite correlated forcing with F = 1 gives rise to the advectionsweeping effect which suppresses Dt, u \u20322 and n\u20322as \u221e \u03bb-2 for \u03bb \u226b \u03c4F-1. In contrast, no influence of the uniform flow is found in the case of a short correlated forcing \u03c4F \u2192 0 due to Galilean invariance. For the shear flow U0 = \u03a9sin xy(\u03a9 = constant shearing rate) with the appropriate choice of the forcing ( \u03c4F \u2192 0) the nature of transport suppression is shown to crucially depend on the properties of the turbulence. Specifically, for prescribed turbulence with a short correlation time \u03c4c = \u03c4F-1, the turbulence statistics scale as Dt \u221e \u03c9-0. 02, n\u20322 \u221e \u03c9 -0. 62 and cross-phase cos 0. 29.

The latter is known to exist in helical turbulence, which is envisioned to arise due to both rotation and convection in solar-type stars. In this contribution, a turbulent flow driven by a nonhelical inhomogeneous forcing and its kinematic dynamo action are studied for a uniform magnetic field in the background of a linear shear flow. By using a quasilinear analysis and a nonperturbative method utilizing a time-dependent wave number, turbulence property and electromotive force are computed for arbitrary shear strength. Due to the large-scale shear flow, the turbulence is highly anisotropic, as a consequence, so is the electromotive force. The latter is found to exist even without rotation due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing, containing not only the \u03b1 effect but also magnetic pumping (the \u03b3 effect representing a transport of magnetic flux by turbulence). Specifically, without shear, only the magnetic pumping exists, aligned with the direction of inhomogeneity. For a weak but nonzero shear, the combined effects of shear and inhomogeneous forcing modify the structure of the magnetic pumping when the inhomogeneity is in the plane of the shear flow, the magnetic pumping becoming bidimensional in that plane. It also induces an \u03b1 tensor which has nondiagonal components. When the inhomogeneity is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow, the \u03b1 effect has three nonzero diagonal components and one off-diagonal component. However, for a sufficiently strong shear, the \u03b3 and \u03b1 effects are suppressed due to shear stabilization which damps turbulence. A simplified dynamo model is then proposed where a large-scale dynamo arises due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing. In particular, the growth of a large-scale axisymmetric magnetic field is demonstrated in case of an inhomogeneity which is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow. Interesting implications of these results for the structure of magnetic fields in star with slow rotation are discussed."},

One of the main challenges is to explain the dispersion in the distribution of stellar rotation rate for young stars. Previous works have advocated diverse mechanisms to explain the presence of fast rotators (FRs) and also of slow rotators (SRs). For instance, dynamo saturation can limit the stellar spin-down and explain the presence of FRs but does not produce enough SRs. Here, we present a new model that can account for the presence of both types of rotators by incorporating fluctuations in the angular momentum loss. This renders the spin-down problem probabilistic in nature, some stars experiencing more braking on average than others. We show that random fluctuations in the loss of angular momentum enhance the population of both FR and SR compared to the deterministic cases (with a linear dynamo prescription or with dynamo saturation). The stochastic angular momentum loss thus provides an alternative physical mechanism to that of a saturated dynamo, with an even better agreement with observations."},

Inspired by such applications, we have investigated thermal convection in a two-dimensional square enclosure heated at the bottom and cooled at the top, with four additional thin vertical partitions arranged parallel to facilitate organized plume motions in the range of Rayleigh numbers 106 to 109. The large-scale classical circulation observed in thermal convection breaks down into many roll configurations based on the constriction gap (S) between the partitions and the conduction walls. Due to their arrangement, we observed increased plume ejection, impact, and shear near the conduction walls when the partitions disturb the thermal boundary layers. The plume ejection and impact on either end of the constriction gap sets a pressure-driven forced convection on the conduction wall, thus increasing overall heat transport by at least an order of magnitude. We found the maximum heat transport when 0.2\u03b4RB<S<0.4\u03b4RB, where \u03b4RB is the time-averaged thermal boundary layer thickness in classical thermal convection. Using both the numerical simulations and a simple control volume-based analysis, we have estimated that the heat transport increases as S3 for small constriction gaps and as an inverse power of S for the large gap limit. With the help of energy dissipation, we have concluded that increasing plume intensity near the conduction walls leads to the observed high heat transport."},

While this configuration is relevant to continuous casting processes that are significantly more complex, we focus on the flow patterns associated with the particular form of mixed convection that arises in it. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, using the spectral element method to identify observable states. The nature of the bifurcations is determined through Stuart\u2013Landau analysis for completeness. The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are however suppressed by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as the Reynolds number Re based on the through-flow exceeds 25. For a sufficiently high Rayleigh number, this base flow is linearly unstable to three different modes, depending on Re. For Re \u2264 75, the rolls destabilise through a supercritical bifurcation into a travelling wave. For 100 \u2264 Re \u2264 110, a subcritical bifurcation leads to a standing oscillatory mode, whereas for Re \u2265 150, the unstable mode is non-oscillatory and grows out of a supercritical bifurcation. The direct numerical simulations confirm that in all cases, the dominant mode returned by the linear stability analysis precisely matches the topology and evolution of the flow patterns that arise out of the fully nonlinear dynamics."},

It is also shown that solid-body rotation of the entire fluid is not realized. It is found that correlation between rotation of LSC plane and the mean azimuthal motion is high during quasiperiodic oscillations of LSC near the diagonal plane and relatively weak during LSC reorientations. We propose a new plausible scenario for the reorientations of the LSC in a cube that does not involve a mean azimuthal flow. Instead of a single-roll, we introduce the superposition of a pair of large-scale orthogonal quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) rolls and the reorientation of the LSC occurs as a result of the cessation of one of the Q2D rolls.

We find that as the turbulent flow evolves in time, the Rossby number decreases to \u223c10\u22123, and the flow becomes quasi-two-dimensional with strong coherent columnar structures arising due to the inverse cascade of energy. We establish that a major fraction of energy is confined in Fourier modes (\u00b11, 0, 0) and (0, \u00b11, 0) that correspond to the largest columnar structure in the flow. For wavenumbers (k) greater than the enstrophy dissipation wavenumber (kd), our phenomenological arguments and numerical study show that the enstrophy flux and spectrum of a horizontal cross section perpendicular to the axis of rotation are given by \u03f5\u03c9exp(\u2212C(k/kd)2) and C\u03f52/3\u03c9k\u22121exp(\u2212C(k/kd)2), respectively; for this 2D flow, \u03f5\u03c9 is the enstrophy dissipation rate, and C is a constant.

To begin with, using geostrophic currents derived from sea-surface height anomaly data provided by AVISO, we confirm the presence of a strong inverse flux of surface KE at scales larger than approximately 250 km. We then compute enstrophy fluxes to help develop a clearer picture of the underlying dynamics at smaller scales, i.e., 250 km to 100 km. Here, we observe a robust enstrophy cascading regime, wherein the enstrophy shows a large forward flux and the KE spectra follow an approximate $k^{-3.5},$ power-law. Given the rotational character of the flow, not only is this large scale inverse KE and smaller scale forward enstrophy transfer scenario consistent with expectations from idealized studies of three-dimensional rapidly-rotating and strongly-stratified turbulence, it also agrees with detailed analyses of spectra and fluxes in the upper level midlatitude troposphere. Decomposing the currents into components with greater and less than 100 day variability (referred to as seasonal and eddy, respectively), we find that, in addition to the eddy-eddy contribution, the seasonal-eddy and seasonal-seasonal fluxes play a significant role in the inverse (forward) flux of KE (enstrophy) at scales larger (smaller) than about 250 km. Taken together, we suspect, it is quite possible that, from about 250 km to 100 km, the altimeter is capturing the relatively steep portion of a surface oceanic counterpart of the upper tropospheric Nastrom-Gage spectrum."},

In the strongly stratified case, a large-scale vertically sheared horizontal flow (VSHF) coexists with small scale turbulence. The VSHF consists of internal gravity waves and the turbulent flow has a kinetic energy (KE) spectrum that follows an approximate k \u22123  scaling with zero KE flux and a robust positive enstrophy flux. The spectrum of the turbulent potential energy (PE) also approximately follows a k \u22123  power-law and its flux is directed to small scales. For moderate stratification, there is no VSHF and the KE of the turbulent flow exhibits Bolgiano\u2013Obukhov scaling that transitions from a shallow k \u221211/5  form at large scales, to a steeper approximate k \u22123  scaling at small scales. The entire range of scales shows a strong forward enstrophy flux, and interestingly, large (small) scales show an inverse (forward) KE flux. The PE flux in this regime is directed to small scales, and the PE spectrum is characterised by an approximate k \u22121.64  scaling. Finally, for weak stratification, KE is transferred upscale and its spectrum closely follows a k \u22122.5  scaling, while PE exhibits a forward transfer and its spectrum shows an approximate k \u22121.6  power-law.

Stellar interiors are the seat of effcient transport of angular momentum all along their evolution. In this context, understanding the dependence of the turbulent transport triggered by the instabilities of the vertical and horizontal shears of the di erential rotation in stellar radiation zones as a function of their rotation, stratification, and thermal di usivity is mandatory. Indeed, it constitutes one of the cornerstones of the rotational transport and mixing theory, which is implemented in stellar evolution codes to predict the rotational and chemical evolutions of stars. Aims. We investigate horizontal shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones by considering the full Coriolis acceleration with both the dimensionless horizontal Coriolis component \u02dc f and the vertical component f . Methods.We performed a linear stability analysis using linearized equations derived from the Navier-Stokes and heat transport equations in the rotating nontraditional f -plane. We considered a horizontal shear flow with a hyperbolic tangent profile as the base flow. The linear stability was analyzed numerically in wide ranges of parameters, and we performed an asymptotic analysis for large vertical wavenumbers using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Je reys (WKBJ) approximation for nondi usive and highly-di usive fluids. Results. As in the traditional f -plane approximation, we identify two types of instabilities: the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional instability is destabilized as \u02dc f increases and its maximum growth rate increases significantly, while the thermal di usivity stabilizes the inflectional instability similarly to the traditional case. The inertial instability is also strongly a ected; for instance, the inertially unstable regime is also extended in the nondi usive limit as 0 < f < 1 + \u02dc f 2=N2, where N is the dimensionless Brunt- V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency. More strikingly, in the high thermal di usivity limit, it is always inertially unstable at any colatitude except at the poles (i.e., 0 < < 180). We also derived the critical Reynolds numbers for the inertial instability using the asymptotic dispersion relations obtained from the WKBJ analysis. Using the asymptotic and numerical esults, we propose a prescription for the e ective turbulent viscosities induced by the inertial and inflectional instabilities that can be possibly used in stellar evolution models.

Although the low-order Lorenz equations have traditionally served as a minimal model for chaotic and intermittent atmospheric motions, even the dynamics of the two-dimensional Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection system is not fully represented by the Lorenz equations, and such differences have yet to be clearly identified in a systematic manner. In this paper, the convection problem is revisited through an investigation of various dynamical behaviors exhibited by a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the generalized expansion of the Lorenz equations (GELE) derived by considering additional higher-order harmonics in the spectral expansions of periodic solutions. Notably, GELE allows us to understand how nonlinear interactions among high-order modes alter the dynamical features of the Lorenz equations including fixed points, chaotic attractors, and periodic solutions. It is verified that numerical solutions of the DNS can be recovered from the solutions of GELE when we consider the system with sufficiently high-order harmonics. At the lowest order, the classic Lorenz equations are recovered from GELE. Unlike in the Lorenz equations, we observe limit tori, which are the multi-dimensional analog of limit cycles, in the solutions of the DNS and GELE at high orders. Initial condition dependency in the DNS and Lorenz equations is also discussed.The Lorenz equations are a simplified nonlinear dynamical system derived from the two-dimensional Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard (RB) convection problem. They have been one of the best-known examples in chaos theory due to the peculiar bifurcation and chaos behaviors. They are often regarded as the minimal chaotic model for describing the convection system and, by extension, weather. Such an interpretation is sometimes challenged due to the simplifying restriction of considering only a few harmonics in the derivation. This study loosens this restriction by considering additional high-order harmonics and derives a system we call the generalized expansion of the Lorenz equations (GELE). GELE allows us to study how solutions transition from the classic Lorenz equations to high-order systems comparable to a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS). This study also proposes mathematical formulations for a direct comparison between the Lorenz equations, GELE, and two-dimensional DNS as the system\u2019s order increases. This work advances our understanding of the convection system by bridging the gap between the classic model of Lorenz and a more realistic convection system."},

Quantifying tidal interactions in close-in two-body systems is of prime interest since they have a crucial impact on the architecture and the rotational history of the bodies. Various studies have shown that the dissipation of tides in either body is very sensitive to its structure and to its dynamics. Furthermore, solar-like stars and giant gaseous planets in our Solar System experience differential rotation in their outer convective envelopes. In this respect, numerical simulations of tidal interactions in these objects have shown that the propagation and dissipation properties of tidally excited inertial waves can be strongly modified in the presence of differential rotation. Aims. In particular, tidal inertial waves may strongly interact with zonal flows at the so-called co-rotation resonances, where the wave's Doppler-shifted frequency is cancelled out. The energy dissipation at such resonances could deeply modify the orbital and spin evolutions of tidally interacting systems. In this context, we aim to provide a deep physical understanding of the dynamics of tidal waves at co-rotation resonances in the presence of differential rotation profiles that are typical of low-mass stars and giant planets. Methods. In this work, we have developed an analytical local model of an inclined shearing box that describes a small patch of the differentially rotating convective zone of a star or a planet. We investigate the propagation and the transmission of free inertial waves at co-rotation, and more generally at critical levels, which are singularities in the governing wave differential equation. Through the construction of an invariant called the wave action flux, we identify different regimes of wave transmission at critical levels, which are confirmed with a one-dimensional three-layer numerical model. Results. We find that inertial waves can be fully transmitted, strongly damped, or even amplified after crossing a critical level. The occurrence of these regimes depends on the assumed profile of differential rotation, on the nature as well as the latitude of the critical level, and on wave parameters such as the inertial frequency and the longitudinal and vertical wavenumbers. Waves can thus either deposit their action flux in the fluid when damped at critical levels, or they can extract action flux from the fluid when amplified at critical levels. Both situations can lead to significant angular momentum exchange between the tidally interacting bodies. "},

Rotational mixing transports angular momentum and chemical elements in stellar radiative zones. It is one of the key processes for modern stellar evolution. In the past two decades, an emphasis has been placed on the turbulent transport induced by the vertical shear instability. However, instabilities arising from horizontal shear and the strength of the anisotropic turbulent transport that they may trigger remain relatively unexplored. The weakest point of this hydrodynamical theory of rotational mixing is the assumption that anisotropic turbulent transport is stronger in horizontal directions than in the vertical one. Aims. This paper investigates the combined effects of stable stratification, rotation, and thermal diffusion on the horizontal shear instabilities that are obtained and discussed in the context of stellar radiative zones. Methods. The eigenvalue problem describing linear instabilities of a flow with a hyperbolic-tangent horizontal shear profile was solved numerically for a wide range of parameters. When possible, the Wentzel Kramers Brillouin Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation was applied to provide analytical asymptotic dispersion relations in both the nondiffusive and highly diffusive limits. As a first step, we consider a polar f -plane where the gravity and rotation vector are aligned. Results. Two types of instabilities are identified: the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional instability that arises from the inflection point (i.e., the zero second derivative of the shear flow) is the most unstable when at a zero vertical wavenumber and a finite wavenumber in the streamwise direction along the imposed-flow direction. While the maximum two-dimensional growth rate is independent of the stratification, rotation rate, and thermal diffusivity, the three-dimensional inflectional instability is destabilized by stable stratification, while it is stabilized by thermal diffusion. The inertial instability is rotationally driven, and a WKBJ analysis reveals that its growth rate reaches the maximum value of p f (1 f ) in the inviscid limit as the vertical wavenumber goes to infinity, where f is the dimensionless Coriolis parameter. The inertial instability for a finite vertical wavenumber is stabilized as the stratification increases, whereas it is destabilized by the thermal diffusion. Furthermore, we found a selfsimilarity in both the inflectional and inertial instabilities based on the rescaled parameter PeN2 with the Pclet number Pe and the Brunt frequency N."},

Two additional physical ingredients are considered in the governing equations, namely, rotation of the model frame and the presence of a density-affecting scalar in the fluid, in order to derive a six-dimensional nonlinear ordinary differential equation system. Since the new system is an extension of the original three-dimensional Lorenz system, the behavior of the new system is compared with that of the old system. Clear shifts of notable bifurcation points in the thermal Rayleigh parameter space are seen in association with the extension of the Lorenz system, and the range of thermal Rayleigh parameters within which chaotic, periodic, and intermittent solutions appear gets elongated under a greater influence of the newly introduced parameters. When considered separately, the effects of scalar and rotation manifest differently in the numerical solutions; while an increase in the rotational parameter sharply neutralizes chaos and instability, an increase in a scalar-related parameter leads to the rise of a new type of chaotic attractor. The new six-dimensional system is found to self-synchronize, and surprisingly, the transfer of solutions to only one of the variables is needed for self-synchronization to occur."},

An analytic expression for the sensitivity is derived for parallel and spatially developing boundary layers, the latter using linear parabolized stability equations and their adjoint. Both the slow mode, S, and the fast mode, F, are investigated at Mach number 4.5. The mode S is more sensitive with respect to distortion in base velocity than in base temperature. The sensitivity is largest within the boundary layer away from the wall. Near the critical layer, where the phase speed of the mode equals the base streamwise velocity, the sensitivity to the base streamwise velocity is negative. For the mode F, there is a discontinuous jump in the sensitivity when the phase speed is below unity, and a critical layer is established. The sensitivity of the two modes increases with the Reynolds number, but there is a sudden drop and a jump in the sensitivities of the modes S and F, respectively, near the synchronization point where the phase speeds of the two modes are equal. Furthermore, the maximum uncertainty bounds are obtained for the distorted base state that maximizes the destabilization or stabilization of the modes by solving the Lagrangian optimization problem for the sensitivity. The sensitivity of the flow stability to surface heating is then studied, and changes in growth rate and the -factor are evaluated. The formulation provides a clear physical interpretation of these changes, and establishes uncertainty bounds for stability predictions for a given level of uncertainty in wall temperature."},

It is shown that not only the centrifugal instability but also the strato-rotational instability can occur. These two instabilities can be explained and well described by means of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys asymptotic analysis for large axial wavenumbers in inviscid and non-diffusive limits. In the presence of viscosity and diffusion, numerical results reveal that the strato-rotational instability becomes dominant over the centrifugal instability at the onset of instability when the axial density stratification is sufficiently strong. Linear transient energy growth is next investigated for counter-rotating cylinders in the stable regime of the Froude number-Reynolds number parameter space. We show that there exist two types of transient growth mechanism analogous to the lift up and the Orr mechanisms in homogeneous fluids but with the additional effect of density perturbations. The dominant mechanism depends on the stratification: when the stratification is strong, non-axisymmetric three-dimensional perturbations achieve the optimal energy growth through the Orr mechanism while for moderate stratification, axisymmetric perturbations lead to the optimal transient growth by a lift-up mechanism involving internal waves."},

In this study, we examine turbulent flow and pollutant dispersion in a densely built-up area in Seoul, South Korea, using the parallelized large-eddy simulation model (PALM). In particular, we focus on vortex streets and associated pollutant dispersion behind high-rise buildings. The turbulence recycling method is used to produce inflow profiles. Vortices are generated near the high-rise buildings and propagate downstream forming vortex streets behind the high-rise buildings. To investigate characteristics of the vortex streets, spectral and correlation analyses are performed. The spectral analysis reveals that vortices have a non-dimensional vortex shedding frequency of 0.1\u20130.2, and this periodicity is weakened due to the influence of other buildings. The correlation analysis shows that vortices appear frequently in regions of negative pressure perturbation. The vertical turbulent momentum fluxes induced by ejections and sweeps largely contribute to the total vertical turbulent momentum flux downstream of the high-rise buildings. Especially, ejections in the wake region are stronger compared to other regions because ejections are induced by vortices near the top of the high-rise buildings. It is found that pollutant dispersion is interrupted by both low-rise and high-rise buildings. Strong updraughts behind the high-rise buildings transport pollutant upward and increase the mean pollutant concentration at upper levels. Vortices forming the vortex streets play a role in pollutant mixing in such a way that the vortices eject air of high pollutant concentration from the wake region behind the high-rise buildings and entrain air of low pollutant concentration into the wake region. The mixing by vortices is verified by the correlation between vorticity and pollutant concentration."},

The growth rate is maximum when only the outer cylinder is rotating and goes to zero when \u03a9(r) is constant. The sufficient condition for linear, inviscid instability derived previously, d\u03a92/dr<0, is therefore extended to d\u03a92/ dr < = 0, meaning that only the regime of solid-body rotation is stable in stratified fluids. A Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) analysis in the inviscid limit, confirmed by the numerical results, shows that the instability occurs only when the Froude number is below a critical value and only for a particular band of azimuthal wavenumbers.

The growth rate of this radiative instability is strongly reduced in the presence of a cyclonic background rotation f/2 and is smaller than the growth rate of the centrifugal instability for anticyclonic rotation, so it is generally expected to affect vortices in geophysical flows only if the Rossby number Ro = 2\u03a9/f is large (where \u03a9 is the angular velocity of the vortex). However, we show here that an anticyclonic Rankine vortex with low Rossby number in the range-1 \u226a Ro < 0, which is centrifugally stable, is unstable to the radiative instability when the azimuthal wavenumber |m| is larger than 2. Its growth rate for Ro =-1 is comparable to the values reported in non-rotating stratified fluids. In the case of continuous vortex profiles, this new radiative instability is shown to occur if the potential vorticity of the base flow has a sufficiently steep radial profile. The most unstable azimuthal wavenumber is inversely proportional to the steepness of the vorticity jump. The properties and mechanism of the instability are explained by asymptotic analyses for large wavenumbers."},

Coronary vasodilation and the physiological mechanisms involved in exercise have frequently been the focus of numerical models for simulating exercise. This is partly achieved using the time-varying-elastance (TVE) theory, which prescribes the pressure-volume relationship of the ventricle as a periodic function of time, tuned using empirical data. The empirical foundations of the TVE method however, and its suitability for CVS modelling are frequently questioned. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a different synergistic approach in which a model for the microscale heart muscle (myofibers) activity is embedded within a macro organ-scale CVS model. We developed such a synergistic model by including the coronary flow and various control mechanisms at the circulation level through feedback and feedforward means, and at the microscale (contractile) through the regulation of ATP availability and myofiber force depending on exercise intensity or heart rate. The coronary flow produced by the model displays the well-known 2-phase character of the flow, which is preserved under exercise. The model is tested by simulating reactive hyperemia, which is a transient occlusion of the coronary flow, successfully reproducing the additional coronary flow following the block removal. On-transient exercise results reveal a rise in both cardiac output and mean ventricle pressure as expected. The stroke volume increases initially, but then declines during the latter period of HR rise, corresponding with one of the main physiological responses to exercise. The pressure-volume loop expands during exercise, as systolic pressure rises. The Myocardial oxygen demand increases during exercise and the coronary blood supply increases in response, causing an excess of oxygen supply to the heart. Off-transient exercise recovery is largely a reverse of this response, although the behaviour is slightly more varied, with sudden spikes in coronary resistance. Different levels of fitness and exercise intensity are tested and reveal that the stroke volume rises until a level of myocardial oxygen demand is reached at which point it declines. This level of demand is independent of fitness or exercise intensity.

Furthermore, the time-varying elastance method that prescribes the pressure\u2013volume relationship rather than calculating it consistently is frequently used for the ventricles and atrium. This method has yet to be validated however, so its applicability for cardiac modelling is frequently questioned. To overcome this challenge, we propose a synergistic model of left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) by self-consistently integrating various feedback mechanisms among the electro-mechanical and chemical functions of the micro-scale myofiber, the macro-scale dynamics of the LA and LV, the atrioventricular node (AV), andcirculation. The model is tested and shown to reproduce the essential features of the atrium cycling, such as the characteristic figure of eight pressure\u2013volume loops. Our model is further developed to investigate the effect of dysfunctions of the mechanical-electric feedback (MEF) in the atrium. Our model not only successfully reproduces key experimental MEF observations such as prolonged action-potential and increases in action-potential magnitude induced by atrial stretch but also shows how MEF and arrhythmia of the atrium lead to a degradation of cardiac output and pumping power with significant consequences. In particular, MEF reproduces arrhythmia such as ectopic and erratic cycling, missed heart beats and restricted function."},

Here, we investigate the effects of variations in the opening and closing times of the valves of the left ventricle at the same time as pathologies in the mechano-electric feedback. To this end, we utilize our synergistic cardio-vascular model without having to use time-varying elastance method. The latter prescribes the pressure-volume relationship in the ventricle directly using a periodic function, neglecting cardiac feedback and regulating mechanisms and is therefore unsuitable for investigating the mechano-electric feedback. We find that the closing time of valves has the greatest effect. A slower closing period of the aortic valve delays the onset of complications caused by the mechano-electric feedback, reducing the susceptibility to systolic stretch. For diastolic stretch, slow mitral valve closing time drastically increases the rise in heartrate and lessens the decline in stroke volume."},

Disorders in the valves of the left ventricle are a prominent example of heart disease, with prolapse, regurgitation, and stenoses\u2014the three main valve disorders. It is widely known that mitral valve prolapse increases the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we investigate stenoses and regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves in the left ventricle using a synergistic low-order numerical model. The model synergy derives from the incorporation of the mechanical, chemical, and electrical elements. As an alternative framework to the time-varying elastance (TVE) method, it allows feedback mechanisms at work in the heart to be considered. The TVE model imposes the ventricular pressure\u2013volume relationship using a periodic function rather than calculating it consistently. Using our synergistic approach, the effects of valve disorders on the mechano-electric-feedback (MEF) are investigated. The MEF is the influence of cellular mechanics on the electrical activity, and significantly contributes to the generation of arrhythmia. We further investigate stenoses and regurgitation of the mitral and aortic valves and their relationship with the MEF and generation of arrhythmia. Mitral valve stenosis is found to increase the sensitivity to arrhythmia-stimulating systolic stretch, and reduces the sensitivity to diastolic stretch. Aortic valve stenosis does not change the sensitivity to arrhythmia-stimulating stretch, and regurgitation reduces it. A key result is found when valve regurgitation is accompanied by diastolic stretch. In the presence of MEF disorder, ectopic beats become far more frequent when accompanied by valve regurgitation. Therefore, arrhythmia resulting from a disorder in the MEF will be more severe when valve regurgitation is present."},

One of these mechanisms, the mechano-electric feedback (MEF), is the electrical response of the heart to local mechanical changes in the environment. This electrical response, in turn, leads to macroscopic changes in heart function. In this paper, we demonstrate that the MEF plays a crucial role in mechanical generation and recovery from arrhythmia which has been observed in experimental studies. To this end, we investigate the cardiac response to a mechanical stimulation using a minimal, multiscale model of the heart which couples the organ level dynamics (left ventricular pressure and volume) and contractile dynamics. By including a mechanical stimulation into the model as a (short, sudden) impulse in the muscle microscale stress, we investigate how the timing, amplitude and duration of the impulse affect the cardiac cycle. In particular, when introduced in the diastolic period of the cardiac cycle, the pulse rate can be stabilised, and ectopic beats and bifurcation can be eliminated, either temporarily or permanently. The stimulation amplitude is a key indicator to this response. We find an optimal value of the impulse amplitude above or below which the impulse maximises the stabilisation. As a result a dysfunction of the MEF can be helped using a mechanical stimulation, by allowing the heart to recover its pumping power. On the other hand, when the mechanical stimulation is introduced towards the end of systole, arrhythmia can be generated."},

Flow was driven, in concert, by a constant pressure gradient and by the synchronous oscillation of the lateral walls. This prototypical setup serves to aid understanding of unsteady magnetohydrodynamic flows in liquid metal coolant ducts subjected to transverse magnetic fields, motivated by the conditions expected in magnetic confinement fusion reactors. A wide range of wall oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, relative to the constant pressure gradient, were simulated. Focus was placed on the driving pulsation optimized for the greatest reduction in the critical Reynolds number for a range of friction parameters H (proportional to magnetic field strength). An almost 70% reduction in the critical Reynolds number, relative to that for the steady base flow, was obtained toward the hydrodynamic limit (H=10\u22127), while just over a 90% reduction was obtained by H=10. For all oscillation amplitudes, increasing H consistently led to an increasing percentage reduction in the critical Reynolds number. This is a promising result, given fusion relevant conditions of H\u2265104. These reductions were obtained by selecting a frequency that both ensures prominent inflection points are maintained in the base flow and a growth in perturbation energy in phase with the deceleration of the base flow. Nonlinear simulations of perturbations driven at the optimized frequency and amplitude still satisfied the no net growth condition at the greatly reduced critical Reynolds numbers. However, two complications were introduced by nonlinearity. First, although the linear mode undergoes a symmetry-breaking process, turbulence was not triggered. Second, a streamwise invariant sheet of negative velocity formed, able to arrest the linear decay of the perturbation. Although the nonlinearly modulated base flow maintained a higher time-averaged energy, it also stabilized the flow, with exponential growth not observed at supercritical Reynolds numbers"},

This is achieved using a model for the quasi-two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow in a duct with moving lateral walls and an orthogonal magnetic field, where three dimensionality persists only in regions of asymptotically small thickness. In this environment, conventional subcritical routes to turbulence, which are highly three dimensional (with large variations from nonzero out-of-plane wave numbers), are prohibited. To elucidate the remaining mechanisms involved in quasi-two-dimensional turbulent transitions, the magnetic field strength and degree of antisymmetry in the base flow are varied, the latter via the relative motion of the lateral duct walls. Introduction of any amount of antisymmetry to the base flow drives the critical Reynolds number infinite, as the Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities take on opposite signs of rotation and destructively interfere. However, an increasing magnetic field strength isolates the instabilities, which, without interaction, permits finite critical Reynolds numbers. The transient growth obtained by similar Tollmien-Schlichting wave perturbations only mildly depends on the base flow, with negligible differences in growth rate for friction parameters H\u227330. Weakly nonlinear analysis determines the local bifurcation type, which is always subcritical at the critical point, and along the entire neutral curve just before the magnetic field strength becomes too low to maintain finite critical Reynolds numbers. Direct numerical simulations, initiated with random noise, indicate that a subcritical bifurcation is difficult to achieve in practice, with only supercritical behavior observed. For H\u22641, supercritical exponential growth leads to saturation but not turbulence. For higher 3\u2264H\u226410, a turbulent transition occurs and is maintained at H=10. For H\u226530, the turbulent transition still occurs, but is short lived, as the turbulent state quickly collapses. In addition, for H\u22653, an inertial subrange is identified, with the perturbation energy exhibiting a \u22125/3 power law dependence on wave number."},

Fluid Mech., vol. 598, 2008, pp. 81-105; Yarom & Sharon, Nat. Phys., vol. 10(7), 2014, pp. 510-514) are generally accepted as the most efficient mechanism to transport energy anisotropically. They have been shown to transfer energy to large anisotropic, columnar structures. Nevertheless, they cannot account for the formation of simpler steady anisotropic phenomena such as Taylor columns. Here, we experimentally show that more than one mechanism involving the Coriolis force may promote anisotropy. In particular, in the limit of fast rotation, that is at low Rossby number, anisotropy favouring the direction of rotation of the average of a turbulent flow arises neither because of inertial waves nor following the same mechanism as in steady Taylor columns, but from an interplay between the Coriolis force and average advection."},

While this configuration is relevant to continuous casting processes that are significantly more complex, we focus on the flow patterns associated with the particular form of mixed convection that arises in it. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, using the spectral element method to identify observable states. The nature of the bifurcations is determined through Stuart\u2013Landau analysis for completeness. The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are however suppressed by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as the Reynolds number Re based on the through-flow exceeds 25. For a sufficiently high Rayleigh number, this base flow is linearly unstable to three different modes, depending on Re. For Re \u2264 75, the rolls destabilise through a supercritical bifurcation into a travelling wave. For 100 \u2264 Re \u2264 110, a subcritical bifurcation leads to a standing oscillatory mode, whereas for Re \u2265 150, the unstable mode is non-oscillatory and grows out of a supercritical bifurcation.

We describe an experimental rig based on this idea, where the Couette flow is entrained by a tape immersed in sulphuric acid and positioned flush onto the bore of large superconducting magnet, so that most of the flow is pervaded by a sufficiently homogeneous transverse magnetic field. Velocity and pressure fields are obtained by means of a bespoke PIV system, capable of recording the fluid\u2019s acceleration as well as its velocity.

Subcritical transitions were detected only at weakly subcritical Reynolds numbers (at most \u224870% below critical). Furthermore, the likelihood of transition was very sensitive to both the perturbation structure and initial energy. Only the quasi-two-dimensional Tollmien\u2013Schlichting wave disturbance, attained by either linear or nonlinear optimization, was able to initiate the transition process, by means of the Orr mechanism. The lower initial energy bound sufficient to trigger transition was found to be independent of the domain length.

This broadens the range of initial energies able to exhibit transitional behavior. Although the eventual relaminarization of all turbulent states was observed, this was also greatly delayed in longer domains. The maximum nonlinear gains achieved were orders of magnitude larger than the maximum linear gains (with the same initial perturbations), regardless if the initial energy was above or below the lower energy bound.

Without background rotation, this apparatus generates a turbulent front whose displacement recovers the law classically obtained with an oscillating grid (Dickinson & Long, Phys. Fluids, vol. 21 (10), 1978, pp. 1698-1701) and we further establish the scale independence of the associated transport mechanism. When the apparatus is rotating at a constant velocity perpendicular to the wall where fluid is injected, not only does the turbulent front become mainly transported by inertial waves, but advection itself is suppressed because of the local deficit of momentum incurred by the propagation of these waves. Scale-by-scale analysis of the displacement of the turbulent front reveals that the transition between advection and propagation is local both in space and spectrally, and takes place when the Rossby number based on the considered scale is of order unity, or equivalently, when the scale-dependent group velocity of inertial waves matched the local advection velocity."},

Two Reynolds numbers of 5000 and 15 000 and an extensive range of Hartmann numbers 0 \u2264 Ha \u2264 800 were investigated. Three broad regimes are identified in which optimal mode topology and non-modal growth mechanisms are distinct.

The second phase also features a second intermediate state where the dynamics is simplified due to frequency locking. (ii) Nonlinear time series analysis enables us to reconstruct the attractor of the underlying dynamical system and to calculate its correlation dimension and leading Lyapunov exponent. Both these quantities bring confirmation that the state preceding the dynamic simplification that initiates the second phase is chaotic. Poincar\u00e9 maps further reveal that this chaotic state in fact results from a dynamic instability of the system between two nonchaotic states respectively observed at slightly lower and slightly higher acoustic forcing."},

The  apparatus  consists of a hemispherical fluid vessel heated in its centre by a protruding heating element of cylindrical  shape.  The  resulting  convection  that  develops  above  the  heater,  i.e.  within the TC, is shown to set in for critical Rayleigh numbers and wavenumbers respectively scaling  as $Ra_c\u223cE^{\u22124/3},$ and $a_c\u223cE^{\u22121/3}, with  the  Ekman  number E.  Although  exhibiting the  same  exponents  as  for  plane  rotating  convection,  these  laws  reflect  much  larger convective   plumes   at   onset.   The   structure   and   dynamics   of   supercritical   plumes are   in   fact   closer   to   those   found   in   solid   rotating   cylinders   heated   from   below, suggesting  that  the  confinement  within  the  TC  induced  by  the  Taylor\u2013Proudman constraint  influences  convection  in  a  similar  way  as  solid  walls  would  do.  There  is a  further  similarity  in  that  the  critical  modes  in  the  TC  all  exhibit  a  slow  retrograde precession  at  onset.  In  supercritical  regimes,  the  precession  evolves  into  a  thermal wind  with  a  complex  structure  featuring  retrograde  rotation  at  high  latitude  and  eitherprograde  or  retrograde  rotation  at  low  latitude  (close  to  the  heater),  depending  on the  criticality  and  the  Ekman  number.  The  intensity  of  the  thermal  wind  measured by  the  Rossby  number $Ro$ scales  as $Ro'5.33(Ra^\u2217_q)^{0.51},$ with  the  Rayleigh  number based  on  the  heat  flux $Ra^\u2217_q \u2208[10^{\u22129},, 10^{\u22126},]$.

Unlike past magnetohydrodynamic setups involving a shallow confinement, the experiment presented here drives turbulence whose dimensionality can be set anywhere between three-dimensional and quasi two-dimensional. In particular, we show that the dimensionality and componentality of the turbulence thus generated are in fact completely fixed by the single parameter  lz(li)/hlz(li)/h , which quantifies the competition between the solenoidal component of the Lorentz force and inertia acting on a turbulent structure of the size of the forcing scale  lili . This parameter is fully tunable thanks to the three operating settings at hand: the injection scale, the intensity of the electric forcing and the magnitude of the magnetic field.

A current paradigm is that the corresponding dissipation increases with the intensity of the magnetic field and as a result turbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong. While this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying turbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex configurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the controversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent anisotropy to profoundly reorganize the structure of turbulence, so their net effect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here we show that when turbulence is forced in a magnetic field that acts on turbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field promotes large, nearly two-dimensional structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the loss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity of turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries important consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets, accretion disks, and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering applications."},

This fundamental study is motivated in part by the desire to enhance heat transfer in the blanket ducts of nuclear fusion reactors. In pure magnetohydrodynamic flows, the imposed transverse magnetic field causes the flow to become quasi-two-dimensional and exhibit disturbances that are localized to the horizontal walls. However, the vertical temperature stratification in Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard flows feature convection cells that occupy the interior region, and therefore the addition of this aspect provides an interesting point for investigation. The linearized governing equations are described by the quasi-two-dimensional model proposed by Sommeria and Moreau [J.

The main idea is to take advantage of the fact that such structures are dissipative and that their presence should reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the flow, when paradoxically, their fine resolution incurs extra computational cost in most current methods. The principle of this method is to use a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structures so as to avoid these extra costs. This leads us to develop an algorithm to implement a spectral method for arbitrary functional bases, and in particular, non-orthogonal ones. We construct a basic implementation of this algorithm to simulate Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flows with an externally imposed, transverse magnetic field, where very thin boundary layers are known to develop along the channel walls. In this case, the sought functional basis can be built out of the eigenfunctions of the dissipation operator, which incorporate these boundary layers, and it turns out to be non-orthogonal. We validate this new scheme against numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence based on a finite volume code and it is found to provide accurate results. Its ability to fully resolve wall-bounded turbulence with a number of modes close to that required by the dynamics is demonstrated on a simple example. This opens the way to full blown simulations of MHD turbulence under very high magnetic fields. Until now such simulations were too computationally expensive. In contrast to traditional methods the computational cost of the proposed method, does not depend on the intensity of the magnetic field.\n\nPublisher statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics .

We find a functional basis to describe the flow, well adapted to the problem of finding the attractor dimension and which is also used in subsequent direct numerical simulation of these flows. For given Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we obtain an upper bound for the dimension of the attractor by means of known bounds on the nonlinear inertial term and this functional basis for the flow. Three distinct flow regimes emerge: a quasi-isotropic three-dimensional (3D) flow, a nonisotropic 3D flow, and a 2D flow. We find the transition curves between these regimes in the space parametrized by Hartmann number Ha and attractor dimension datt. We find how the attractor dimension scales as a function of Reynolds and Hartmann numbers (Re and Ha) in each regime. We also investigate the thickness of the boundary layer along the bounding wall and find that in all regimes this scales as 1/Re, independently of the value of Ha, unlike Hartmann boundary layers found when the field is normal to the channel. The structure of the set of least dissipative modes is indeed quite different between these two cases but the properties of turbulence far from the walls (smallest scales and number of degrees of freedom) are found to be very similar.\n\n"},

We show that the dimensionality of the leading order can be fully described using the single parameter l\u03bdz/h, where l\u03bdz represents the distance over which the Lorentz force is able to act before being balanced by viscous dissipation. The base flow happens to introduce inertial recirculations in the meridional plane at the first order, which are shown to follow two radically different mechanisms: inverse Ekman pumping driven by a vertical pressure gradient along the axis of the vortex, or direct Ekman pumping driven by a radial pressure gradient in the Hartmann boundary layers. We demonstrate that when the base flow is quasi-2D, the relative importance of direct and inverse pumping is solely determined by the aspect ratio \u03b7/h, where \u03b7 refers to the width of the vortex. Of the two mechanisms, only inverse pumping appears to act as a significant source of helicity."},

The domain considered is bounded by periodic boundary conditions in the two directions perpendicular to the magnetic field and by two plane Hartmann walls in the third direction. Regimes of high magnetic fields (Hartmann number of up to 896) are reached thanks to a new spectral method using the eigenvectors of the dissipation operator. The decay is found to proceed through two phases: first, energy and integral length scales vary rapidly during a two-dimensionalisation phase extending over approximately a Hartmann friction time. During this phase, the evolution of the former appears significantly more impeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales are nearly quasi-two-dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a two-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers and the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of the decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped structures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay entirely dominated by friction in the Hartmann layers is not reached because of residual dissipation in the bulk. However, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that subsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity gradients. In the process, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic field is found to be strongly suppressed, as is skewness. This result reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober (Fluid Dyn., vol. 9, 1974, pp. 621\u2013624), where, as in the present simulations, Hartmann walls were present."},

The jet is produced by a plane circular ultrasonic transducer in a cavity inside a water tank, either in the near field or in the far field of the acoustic beam. The approach combines an experimental characterization of both the acoustic field and the obtained acoustic streaming velocity field on one hand, with both scaling analysis and CFD using an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver on the other hand. It is shown that good comparisons between experimental and numerical results can be obtained with a theoretical model based on a linear acoustic propagation model accounting for diffraction coupled to a hydrodynamic model including inertia effects. The coupling is obtained by the introduction of a momentum source term, the acoustic streaming force, in the hydrodynamic model. Both experimentally and numerically, the shape of the flow is thus found to be directly affected by both the overall shape of the acoustic beam and the local variations in acoustic pressure amplitude, in particular in the acoustic near field. Through scaling analysis, two scaling laws featuring linear or square root variations of the streaming velocity level with the acoustic power have been found. These scaling laws are shown to apply with a reasonable agreement to our numerical and experimental data, as well as to other former experimental investigations found in the literature."},

We focus on the mechanisms that determine whether the flow is quasi-two-dimensional, three-dimensional or in any intermediate state. To this end, forcing is applied by injecting a DC current I through one wall of the cube only, to drive vortices spinning along the magnetic field. Depending on the intensity of the externally applied magnetic field, these vortices extend part or all of the way through the cube. Driving the flow in this way allows us to precisely control not only the forcing intensity but also its dimensionality. A comparison with the theoretical analysis of this configuration singles out the influences of the walls and of the forcing on the flow dimensionality. Flow dimensionality is characterised in several ways. First, we show that when inertia drives three-dimensionality, the velocity near the wall where current is injected scales as Ub\u223cI2/3.

In the classical Bodew\u00e4dt problem, where the swirl tends towards an asymptotic value away from the wall, the well-known \"tea-cup effect\" drives a flow away from the plate at the centre of the vortex. Simple dimensional arguments applied to a single vortex show that if the intensity of the swirl decreases away from the wall, the sense of the recirculation can be inverted, and that the associated flow rate scales with the swirl gradient. If the flow is quasi-2D, the classical tea-cup effect takes place. This basic theory is confirmed by numerical simulations of a square array of steady, electrically driven vortices. Experiments in the turbulent regimes of the same configuration reveal that these mechanisms are active in the average flow and in its fluctuating part. These mechanisms provide an explanation for previously observed phenomena in electrolyte flows. They also put forward a possible mechanism for the generation of helicity in flows close to two-dimensionality, which plays a key role in the transition between 2D and 3D turbulence.

(defined as the ratio of bend opening to the inlet width) vary in the respective ranges [0-2500] and [0.1-10]. In the outlet, the sequence of flow regimes is found to bear similarities with the flow behind a two-dimensional cylinder, despite being asymmetric by nature: when Re was increased, we found a laminar flow, then a flow with a first recirculation attached to the inside boundary, then one with a second recirculation attached to the top boundary. The onset of unsteadiness occurs through instability of the main stream and vortex shedding from the inside boundary. For ? ? 0.2, the flow is characterised by the dynamics of the jet generated at the very small turning part whereas for ? ? 0.3, it behaves rather like the flow behind an obstacle placed in a channel. This difference is most noticeable in the unsteady regimes where the vortex shedding mechanisms differ. While the former generates a more turbulent flow rich in small scale turbulence, the latter produces large structures of the size of the channel. In the turning part, further series of recirculation develop in each corner, akin to those identified by Moffatt [\"Viscous and resistive eddies near a sharp corner,\" J. Fluid Mech.18, 1 (1964)10.1017/S0022112064000015]. For ? > 1 corresponding eddies merge to form a series of alternately rotating recirculating cells, which occupy the whole width of the turning part. We find that for ? > 1, the effective opening ratio ?*, which correspond to the area occupied by the mainstream while passing from the inlet to the outlet, tends towards a value of ?0.7. The combination of regimes in the outlet and the turning part yields a wealth of flow regimes, which open interesting possibilities to tailor the design of 180\u00b0 bends to suit particular applications involving mixing, heat, and mass transfer. Selected 3D simulations show that with a few noticeable exceptions, 2D dynamics determine the main features of the flow (drag and recirculation length), even in a wide bend, while 3D structure tends to slow down the shedding mechanism. 2D simulations are thus not only relevant to configurations where the flow is expected to be 2D (thin bend, MHD flows), but also to 3D flows where they can predict some of the global flow features at a low computational cost. \n\nThis abstract contains mathematical symbols which do not display correctly on this platform - please see the attached published version or the abstract on the publisher's website http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4807070\n\n"},

To achieve this, we optimize the design of a magnet system based on Halbach arrays placed on either side of the duct. In the process, we show that the fluid flow can be approximated as a moving solid bar with practically no impact on the optimization result and devise a rather general iterative optimization procedure, which incurs drastically less computational cost than a direct procedure of equivalent precision. We show that both the Lorentz force and the efficiency of the system (defined as the ratio of the Lorentz force to the weight of the system) can be increased several fold by using Halbach arrays made of three, five, seven or nine magnets on either side of the duct but that this improvement comes at a cost in terms of the precision required to position the system."},

In steady flows dominated by the Lorentz force, with negligible inertia, we provide the first numerical flow visualization of Hunt\u2019s wake. In regimes of finite inertia, a thorough topological analysis of the steady flow regimes reveals how the Lorentz force gradually reorganizes the flow structures in the hydrodynamic wake of the cylinder as the Hartmann number Ha (which gives a non-dimensional measure of the magnetic field) is increased. The nature of the vortex shedding follows from this rearrangement of the steady structures by the magnetic field. As Ha is increased, we observe that the vortex street changes from a strongly symmetric one to the alternate procession of counter-rotating vortices typical of the non-truncated cylinder wakes.\n\n"},

This is achieved by modelling the wall shear stress in these layers using Prandtl\u2019s mixing length model, as did by Alboussi\u00e8re and Lingwood [Phys. Fluids 12(6), 1535 (2000)]. The idea for this new model arose from the failure of previous shallow water models that assumed a laminar Hartmann layer to recover the correct amount of dissipation found in some regimes of the MATUR experiment. This experiment, conducted by Messadek and Moreau [J. Fluid Mech. 456, 137 (2002)], consisted of a thin layer of mercury electrically driven in differential rotation in a transverse magnetic field. Numerical simulations of our new model in the configuration of this experiment allowed us to recover experimental values of both the global angular momentum and the local velocity up to a few percent when the Hartmann layer was in a sufficiently well developed turbulent state. We thus provide an evidence that the unexplained level of dissipation observed in MATUR in these specific regimes was caused by turbulence in the Hartmann layers. A parametric analysis of the flow, made possible by the simplicity of our model, also revealed that turbulent friction in the Hartmann layer prevented quasi-2D turbulence from becoming more intense and limited the size of the large scales.\n\n"},

The effect is first demonstrated on a numerical model for an infinitely long joint such as: we illustrate how the joint shape can be controlled by varying the inclination of the inductor and for a magnetic Bond number Bom = 60 (which measures the ratio of electromagnetic to capillary forces), we obtain a joint of aspect ratio up to 7.2.

A pair of counterrotating vortice is electrically driven in the center of a thin horizontal liquid metal layer, enclosed in a cylindrical container and subject to a homogeneous vertical magnetic field. When the forcing is increased, the pair is displaced away from the center. Boundary layer separations from the circular wall appear that trigger a sequence of supercritical bifurcations. These are singled out in numerical calculations based on our previously developed shallow water model as well as in the experiment, and these bifurcations are shown to resemble those observed in flows past a cylindrical obstacle. For the highest forcing, the flow then ends up in a turbulent regime where the dissipation increases drastically, which we could relate to a possible transition from a laminar to a turbulent Hartmann boundary layer. Finally we show the first experimental evidence of a transition to three-dimensionality in liquid metal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by comparing velocity measurements on either horizontal sides of the layer as we find that columnar vortice wobble for a high enough forcing."},

We show that such a basis can be obtained from the eigenvalue problem of the linear part of the governing equations with the problem's boundary conditions. Since this basis is not always orthogonal, we develop a spectral method for non-orthogonal bases.

In particular, we show that this method eliminates the computational costs incurred this Hartmann layer, and this for arbitrary high magnetic fields B.

We perform a parametric study by varying the two control parameters Re and Ha (Ha2 is the ratio of Lorentz to viscous forces) in the ranges [0...6000] and [0...2160], respectively. The flow is found to exhibit a sequence of four regimes. The first three regimes are similar to those of the non-magnetohydrodynamic (non-MHD) 2D circular wake, with transitions controlled by the friction parameter Re/Ha. The fourth one is characterized by vortices raising from boundary layer separations at the duct side walls, which strongly disturbs the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street.

Fluid Mech. 504, 167 (2004)], we study the stability of a flow of liquid metal in a rectangular, electrically insulating duct with a steady homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to two of the walls. In this configuration, the Lorentz force tends to eliminate the velocity variations in the direction of the magnetic field. This leads to a quasi-two-dimensional base flow with Hartmann boundary layers near the walls perpendicular to the magnetic field, and so-called Shercliff layers in the vicinity of the walls parallel to the field. Also, the Lorentz force tends to strongly oppose the growth of perturbations with a dependence along the magnetic field direction. On these grounds, we represent the flow using the model from Sommeria and Moreau [J. Fluid Mech. 118, 507 (1982)], which essentially consists of two-dimensional (2D) motion equations with a linear friction term accounting for the effect of the Hartmann layers. The simplicity of this quasi-2D model makes it possible to study the stability and transient growth of quasi-two-dimensional perturbations over an extensive range of nondimensional parameters and reach the limit of high magnetic fields. In this asymptotic case, the Reynolds number based on the Shercliff layer thickness Re/H1/2 becomes the only relevant parameter. Tollmien-Schlichting waves are the most linearly unstable mode as for the Poiseuille flow, but for H\u226542, a second unstable mode, symmetric about the duct axis, appears with a lower growth rate. We find that these layers are linearly unstable for Re/H1/2\u226548350 and energetically stable for Re/H1/2 Re/H1/2\u226465.32. Between these two bounds, some nonmodal quasi-two-dimensional perturbations undergo some significant transient growth (between two and seven times more than in the case of a purely 2D Poiseuille flow, and for much more subcritical values of Re). In the limit of a high magnetic field, the maximum gain Gmax associated with this transient growth is found to vary as Gmax\u223c(Re/Rec)2/3 and occur at time tGmax\u223c(Re/Rec)1/3 for streamwise wavenumbers of the same order of magnitude as the critical wavenumber for the linear stability."},

A flow between two parallel walls with an imposed perpendicular magnetic field is considered. The flow is defined by its maximum velocity and the intensity of the magnetic field. Given the corresponding Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, one can rigorously derive an upper bound for the dimension of the attractor and find out which modes must be chosen to achieve this bound. The properties of these modes yield quantities that we compare to known heuristic estimates for the size of the smallest turbulent vortices and the degree of anisotropy of the turbulence. Our upper bound derivation is based on known bounds of the nonlinear inertial term, while low-Rm Lorentz forces - being linear - can be relatively easily dealt with. The simple configuration considered in this paper allows us to identify some boundaries separating different sets of modes in the space of nondimensional parameters, which are reminiscent of three important previously identified transitions observed in the real flow. The first boundary separates classical hydrodynamic sets of modes from MHD sets where anisotropy takes the form of a \"Joule cone.\" In the second, one can define the boundary separating three-dimensional (3D) MHD sets from quasi-two-dimensional (2D) MHD sets, when all \"Orr-Sommerfeld modes\" disappear and only \"Squire modes\" are left. The third separates sets where all the modes exhibit the same boundary layer thickness or so, and sets where many different \"boundary layer modes\" coexists in the set. The nondimensional relations defining these boundaries are then compared to the heuristics known for the transition between isotropic and anisotropic MHD turbulence, 3D and quasi-2D MHD turbulence, and that between a turbulent and a laminar Hartmann layer. In addition to this 3D approach, we also determine upper bounds for the dimension of forced turbulent flows modeled using a 2D MHD equation, which should become physically relevant in the quasi-2D MHD regime. The advantage of this 2D approach is that, while upper bounds are quite loose in three dimensions, optimal upper bounds exist for the 2D nonlinear term. This allows us to derive realistic attractor dimensions for quasi-2D MHD flows."},

To this end, we find an upper bound for the maximum growth rate of any n-dimensional volume of the phase space by the evolution operator associated to the Navier-Stokes equations. As explained in Constantin et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 150, 427 (1985)], the value of n for which this maximum is zero is an upper bound for the attractor dimension. In order to use this property in the more precise case of a three-dimensional periodical domain, we are led to calculate the distribution of n modes which minimizes the total (viscous and Joule) dissipation. This set of modes turns out to exhibit most of the well known properties of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, previously obtained by heuristic considerations such as the existence of the Joule cone under strong magnetic field. The sought estimates for the small scales and attractor dimension are then obtained under no physical assumption as functions of the Hartmann and the Reynolds numbers and match the Hartmann number dependency of heuristic results. A necessary condition for the flow to be tridimensional and anisotropic (as opposed to purely two-dimensional) is also built."},

A method is presented that allows three-dimensional effects to be taken into account in a two-dimensional equation of motion thanks to a model for the transverse velocity profile. This model is obtained by using a double perturbation asymptotic development both in the core flow and in the Hartmann layers arising along the planes. A new model is thus constructed that describes inertial effects in these two regions. Two separate classes of phenomena are found: one related to inertial effects in the Hartmann layer gives a model for recirculating flows and the other introduces the possibility of having a transverse dependence of the velocity profile in the core flow. The 'recirculating' velocity profile is then introduced in the transversally averaged equation of motion in order to provide an effective two-dimensional equation of motion. Analytical solutions of this model are obtained for two experimental configurations: isolated vortices generated by a point electrode and axisymmetric parallel layers occurring in the MATUR (MagneticTURbulence) experiment. The theory is found to give a satisfactory agreement with the experiment so that it can be concluded that recirculating flows are actually responsible for both vortex core spreading and excessive dissipative behaviour of the axisymmetric sidewall layers."},

This is possible only at specific combinations of the upstream and downstream states. Two such combinations are identified with arbitrary upstream and downstream interface heights. The first has a cross-symmetry between the interface height and shear on both sides of the jump. This symmetry, which is due to the invariance of the two-layer shallow-water system with swapping the interface height and shear, ensures the automatic conservation of the impulse and energy as well as the continuity of characteristic velocities across the jump. The speed at which such jumps propagate is defined uniquely by the conservation of the mass and circulation. The other possibility is a marginally stable shear flow that can have fully conservative jumps with discontinuous characteristic velocities. Both types of conservative jumps are shown to represent a long-wave approximation to the so-called solibores that appear as smooth permanent-shape solutions in a weakly non-hydrostatic model. A new analytical solution for solibores is obtained and found to agree very well with the previous DNS results for partial-depth lock release flow. The finding that certain large-amplitude hydraulic jumps can be fully conservative, while most are not such even in the inviscid approximation, points towards the wave dispersion as a primary mechanism behind the lossy nature of internal bores"},

The magnetic field was measured using Hall probes which were fixed on the top face of the coil. We measured also the radial voltage drop across the coil. When the disc rotation rate reached \u03a9 \u2248 7 Hz , the magnetic field increased steeply approaching B 0 \u2248 40 mT in the central part of the coil. This field was more than two orders of magnitude stronger than the background magnetic field. In the first two runs, the electromagnetic torque braking the disc in the dynamo regime exceeded the breakdown torque of the electric motor driving the disc.

The problem is solved by the method of characteristics using analytic expressions for the Riemann invariants. The obtained solution, which represents an inviscid approximation to the high-Reynolds-number limit, is, in general, discontinuous containing up to three hydraulic jumps which are due to either multivaluedness or instability of the continuous SW solution. Hydraulic jumps are resolved by applying the Rankine\u2013Hugoniot conditions for the SW mass and generalized momentum conservation equations. The latter contains a free parameter \u03b1 which defines the relative contribution of each layer to the interfacial pressure gradient. We consider a solution for [Formula: see text] which corresponds to both layers affecting the interfacial pressure gradient with equal weight coefficients. This solution is compared with the solutions resulting from the application of the classical Benjamin's front condition as well as the circulation conservation condition, which correspond to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively. The SW solution reproduces all principal features of 2D numerical solution for viscous fluids. The gravity current speed is found to agree well with experimental and numerical results when the front acquires the largest stable height which occurs at [Formula: see text].

If the product of electric current and magnetic field exceeds a certain critical threshold depending on the cell design, the electromagnetic coupling of gravity wave modes can give rise to a self-amplifying rotating interfacial wave which is known as the metal pad instability. Using the eigenvalue perturbation method, we show that, in the inviscid limit, rectangular cells of horizontal aspect ratios $\\alpha=\\sqrt{m/n},$, where $m$ and $n$ are any two odd numbers, can be destabilised by an infinitesimally weak electromagnetic interaction while cells of other aspect ratios have finite instability thresholds. This fractal distribution of critical aspect ratios, which form an absolutely discontinuous dense set of points interspersed with aspect ratios with non-zero stability thresholds, is confirmed by accurate numerical solution of the linear stability problem. Although the fractality vanishes when viscous friction is taken into account, the instability threshold is smoothed out gradually and its principal structure, which is dominated by the major critical aspect ratios corresponding to moderate values of $m$ and $n$, is well-preserved up to relatively large dimensionless viscous friction coefficients $\\gamma\\sim 0.1$.

This type of flowmeter operates by tracking eddy-current markers excited by the magnetic field pulses in the flow of a conducting liquid. Using a simple mathematical model, where the fluid flow is replaced by a translating cylinder, a number possible alternative measurement schemes are considered. The velocity of the medium can be measured by tracking zero crossing points and spatial or temporal extrema of the electromotive force (emf) induced by transient eddy currents in the surrounding space. Zero crossing points and spatial extrema of the emf travel synchronously with the medium whereas temporal extrema experience an initial time delay which depends on the conductivity and velocity of the medium. Performance of transient eddy-current flowmetering depends crucially on the symmetry of system. Eddy current asymmetry of a few per cent makes the detection point drift with a velocity corresponding to a magnetic Reynolds number $Rm\\sim 0.1.$ With this level of asymmetry transient eddy-current flowmetering can be reliably applicable only to flows with $Rm\\gtrsim 0.1.$ A more accurate symmetry adjustment or calibration of flowmeters may be necessary at lower velocities.

We measured the magnetic field above the disc and the voltage drop on the coil for the rotation rate up to 14 Hz, at which the liquid metal started to leak from the outer sliding contact. Instead of the steady magnetic field predicted by the theory we detected a strongly fluctuating magnetic field with a strength comparable to that of Earth's magnetic field which was accompanied by similar voltage fluctuations in the coil.

Axially symmetric disturbances are considered in the inductionless approximation corresponding to zero magnetic Prandtl number. Axial symmetry allows us to reveal an entirely new electromagnetic instability. First, we show that the electric current passing through the liquid can extend the range of helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) indefinitely by transforming it into a purely electromagnetic instability. Two different electromagnetic instability mechanisms are identified. The first is an internal pinch-type instability, which is due to the interaction of the electric current with its own magnetic field. Axisymmetric mode of this instability requires a free-space component of the azimuthal magnetic field. When the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of electromagnetic instability emerges. The latter, driven by the interaction of electric current with a weak collinear magnetic field in a quiescent fluid, gives rise to a steady meridional circulation coupled with azimuthal rotation.\n\n"},

Both relatively low-cost methods work especially well for oxides melting above the maximum operating temperature of conventional crucibles or that were previously impossible to grow due to crucible oxidation or reaction of the melt with the crucible material. For incongruently melting oxides, solvents with experimentally determined composition allow for creation of practical steady state conditions. This extends the range of materials that now can be crystallized in oxidizing, reducing, and neutral atmospheres and elevated pressure. Distribution of dopants is relatively uniform.The important problems of zone stabilization and its dependence on the conditions applied are discussed from the experimental point of view. Basic characterization of the grown crystals and most characteristic defects is presented. An extensive list of oxide crystals grown by the OFZ method is included.Floating zone crystal growth with radio frequency (RF) heating is an important technique for the preparation of single bulk crystals. The absence of any crucible is advantageous for the growth of single crystals of reactive materials with high melting points. The melt convection driven by the induction heating and the heat radiation from the surface leads usually to a solid-liquid interface being concave toward the solid phase outer rim. These concave parts inhibit the growth of single crystals over the whole cross-section. The concave solid-liquid interface can be prevented by a two-phase inductor that melts the material but also stirs it in a certain way. The basic design of this two-phase inductor is given, and its application for the growth of industrially relevant single crystals of RuAl and TiAl intermetallic compounds as well as interesting compounds for research such as antiferromagnetic Heusler MnSi compounds or biocompatible TiNb alloys is described."},

However the elimination is constrained by the conservation of the structure of matrix eigenvalue problem, it can be done in two basically different ways. A straightforward application of the method results in a couple of physically spurious eigenvalues which are either huge or close to zero depending on the way the vorticity boundary conditions are eliminated. The zero eigenvalues can be shifted to any prescribed value and thus removed by a slight modification of the second approach."},

The advantage of the floating-zone method is the crucible-free growth of single crystals of reactive materials with high melting points. The strong heat diffusion on the surface, as well as the melt convection in the molten zone due to induction heating, often leads to an undesired solid-liquid interface geometry with a concave (towards the solid phase) outer rim. These concave parts aggravate the single crystal growth over the full cross-section. A two-phase stirrer was developed at IFW Dresden in order to avoid the problems connected with these concave parts. It acts as a magnetic field pump and changes the typical double vortex structure to a single roll structure, thus pushing hot melt into the regions where the concave parts may arise. The current in the secondary coil is induced by the primary coil, and the capacitor and the resistance of the secondary circuit are adjusted to get a stable 90 degree phase-shift between the coil currents. Single crystal growth of industrial relevant RuAl and TiAl intermetallic compounds was performed based on the material parameters and using the adjusted two-phase stirrer.

Flow measurements revealed an anomalous behavior of the flow: Pronounced oscillations of both the primary swirling and the secondary recirculating flow occur spontaneously. This peculiarity can be attributed to the influence of the oxide layer at the surface of the metal. The motion of the covering layer is governed by the strength of the fluid flow and the properties of the layer, and it might exhibit three different states of motion: permanent rotation, intermittent rotation, or the quiescent state. The regime of an intermittent oxide layer rotation reveals a striking influence on the bulk flow of the liquid metal. The amplitude of the velocity oscillations observed seems to be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of turbulent fluctuations in a steady RMF-driven flow.

The resulting microstructure of the alloy in consideration of melt convection has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The average SDAS was determined for each sample from the whole cross-section of the cylindrical test samples using image analyzing software LEICA QWIN. A detailed statistical analysis of the spacing distribution was performed on the basis of the variation of SDAS values, averaged from about 80 to 120 dendrites in different zones. The \u03b1-Fe volume fraction, measured by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), reduces with increasing crucible rotation frequency.

Since the magnetic and mechanical properties of these technologically relevant materials depend strongly on the microstructure and especially on the volume fraction of the properitectic phase, there is a growing scientific interest for such an investigation. On the basis of numerical simulation of melt convection modes in an inductively heated metallic melt, novel techniques for the modification of the melt convection were developed. This is the forced rotation technique and a modified floating zone facility equipped with a specially designed double coil system, which enabled the application of additional magnetic fields. The forced rotation technique, in which the crucible rotates with well-defined frequencies, leads in accordance with numerical simulation to a strong reduction of the melt convection depending on the frequency. The volume fraction of the soft magnetic \u03b1-Fe phase could be drastically reduced in comparison with the common induction melting accompanied by a simultaneous reduction of the secondary dendritic arm spacing. The floating zone facility with the patented double coil system allows the tailoring of the melt convection over a wide range from nil motion to strong stirring. The microstructure of the investigated Ti-Al alloy changed from dendritic to globulitic morphology under strong stirring, whereas the volume fraction of the properitectic phase increased with increasing stirring. The mechanical properties show a significant increased plastic deformation of the samples solidified under strong stirring. The possible reason for the change in morphology is explained as a result of spherical growth under forced convection. The study of the influence of melt convection on the microstructure formation of peritectic alloys showed the feasibility of tailoring the microstructure and the properties of the resulting alloy by customized melt convection using magnetic fields."},

In order to accomplish reasonable homogeneity and high porosity, the cross-sectional area of the fibers and the width of distribution thereof need to be small. This article studies two techniques for making fibers. Melt extraction out of a crucible yields filaments with a typical diameter ranging from 50 to 200 \u03bcm, which is too thick. Also patented for a long time is the extraction from a pendant drop. Even though relatively fine fibers can be manufactured with this method, it never exceeded crucible extraction with respect to industrial importance owing to the low productivity of the process. The present article addresses the drawbacks of both variants of melt extraction of metallic filaments. Because metallic melts are electrically conducting, the use of magnetic fields allows for contactless process optimization. It is well believed that increasing the extraction speed diminishes the fiber diameter. Being not always true, at least in the case of crucible melt extraction, as indicated by the present findings, however, undesired fluid flow, i.e., turbulence, imposes an upper limit on the rotation rate of the extraction wheel. Application of a static magnetic field leads to both higher wheel speed and thinner filaments. The low productivity of extraction from the molten tip of a rod suffers from the fact that only one melt drawing edge can be used. As the bare rod is problematic with respect to heating its tip in contact with the extraction wheel, it is challenging to melt the entire edge of a sheet. A special design of the induction-heating magnetic field is also proposed to solve also this task."},

Properties are deduced from direct measurements of position or temperature using specific models. Our purpose is to check various assumptions on which those models are built by the use of adapted numerical codes. We first compare experimental and numerical results concerning the shape and mass centre oscillation frequencies of electromagnetically levitated Nickel droplets. Axisymmetric numerical model yields equilibrium shapes and positions of the droplets in a good agreement with experiment. Then, fluid flow effects on the measurement precision of surface tension and viscosity by comparing expected and calculated properties values are characterized. We determine critical values of initial droplet distortion or magnetic field intensity which can lead to an overestimate of the value of viscosity.

For the deposition of thin coatings (\u223c < 100\u00a0nm) on polymer webs and thin metal foils, magnetron sputtering has become the predominant technology. However, the deposition rate obtained with magnetron sputtering is too low to be economically interesting for the metal sheet and strip businesses. Here, the high rate electron beam (EB) PVD seems to become the state of the art technology, probably together with jet vapour deposition (JVD) for the high vapour pressure or low boiling point metals like zinc and magnesium. This paper presents a novel PVD process developed at Corus, which may alleviate some of the disadvantages and should combine the advantages of both EB PVD and JVD. The process is based on the well-known technology of levitation of conductive materials in high frequency electromagnetic fields. By proper induction coil design high power densities can be achieved and metals with low vapour pressures like aluminium, nickel and copper, as well as alloys can easily be evaporated. The vapour produced can be guided to the substrate by a properly designed vapour distribution system, which achieves excellent coating uniformity and a very high vapour utilisation. The proof that every single step of this novel concept works is presented in this publication. Moreover, extra advantages of this technology i.e. the creation of a plasma during evaporation, are discussed. Further up scaling of this technology, together with Posco, should demonstrate the technical and economical feasibility for application in the metal strip coating business. This technology may also find very valuable applications in other fields of PVD coating e.g. in coating of non-flat surfaces."},

First, we point out that magnetic field adds more dissipation while it does not change the base flow which is the only source of energy for growing perturbations.

The detailed analysis reveals a complex internal structure of the boundary layer consisting of eight subregions. The development of the boundary layer starts from the rim region where the concentration, according to the obtained similarity solution, varies with the radius r along the solidification front as \u223cln1/3(R0/r). At intermediate radii, where the corresponding concentration is found to vary as \u223cln(R0/r), the boundary layer has an inner diffusion sublayer adjacent to the solidification front, an inner core region, and an outer diffusion sublayer which separates the former from the outer uniformly mixed region. The inner core, where the solute transport is dominated by convection, is characterized by a logarithmically decreasing axial concentration distribution. The logarithmic increase of concentration along the radius is limited by the radial diffusion becoming effective in the vicinity of the symmetry axis at distances comparable to the characteristic thickness of the solute boundary layer."},

The paper focuses on a calculation of axisymmetric Green's function for the Helmholtz equation which is both simpler and more accurate than previous approaches. We use three different techniques for calculation of Green's function, depending on the parameter range. For low and high ac frequencies, we use a power series expansion in terms of elliptical integrals and an asymptotic series in terms of modified Bessel functions of second kind, respectively. For the intermediate frequency range, we use Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto quadratures. We verify the accuracy of the method by comparing its results with the analytical solution for a sphere in a uniform external ac field.

The layer is treated as a perfectly conducting liquid sheet that allows us to solve the problem analytically for both a semi-infinite geometry with a straight edge and a thin disk of finite radius. It is shown that the long-wave perturbations of a straight edge are monotonically unstable when the wave number exceeds the critical value kc = F0 /(\u03b3 l0), which is determined by the linear density of the electromagnetic force F0 acting on the edge, the surface tension \u03b3, and the effective arclength of edge thickness l0. Perturbations with wavelength shorter than critical are stabilized by the surface tension, whereas the growth rate of long-wave perturbations reduces as \u223ck for k\u21920. Thus, there is the fastest growing perturbation with the wave number kmax =2/3 kc. When the layer is arranged vertically, long-wave perturbations are stabilized by the gravity, and the critical perturbation is characterized by the capillary wave number kc = g\u03c1/\u03b3, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and \u03c1 is the density of metal. In this case, the critical linear density of electromagnetic force is F0,c =2 kc l0 \u03b3, which corresponds to the critical current amplitude I0,c =4 \u03c0 kc l0 L\u03b3/ \u03bc0 when the magnetic field is generated by a straight wire at the distance L directly above the edge.

First, we calculate numerically the magnetic vector potential in grid points on the surface of the sphere and then use Legendre and fast Fourier transforms to find the expansion of the magnetic field in terms of spherical harmonics. Second, we employ a previously developed gauge transformation to solve analytically the 3D electromagnetic problem in terms of the numerically obtained expansion coefficients. Using this solution, we obtain the electromagnetic reaction force due to both a small displacement of the sphere from its equilibrium position and its velocity of motion which are defined by symmetric stiffness and damping matrices, respectively. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stiffness matrix yield three principal stiffness coefficients, which all have to be positive for the equilibrium state to be statically stable, and three mutually orthogonal directions of principal oscillations. Dynamic instabilities are characterized by critical ac frequencies which, when exceeded, may result either in a spin up or oscillations with increasing amplitude. The effective electromagnetic damping coefficients are found by using a classical eigenvalue perturbation theory. A theoretical approach based on the vector field transformation by a small rotation in combination with a parametric frequency derivative is introduced to find the electromagnetic reaction torque due to a slow rotation of the sphere in a 3D ac magnetic field."},

We show that the classical Burton-Prim-Slichter (BPS) solution describing the effect of a diverging flow on the solute incorporation into the solidifying material breaks down for the flows converging along the solidification front. The breakdown is caused by a divergence of the integral defining the effective boundary layer thickness which is the basic concept of the BPS theory. Although such a divergence can formally be avoided by restricting the axial extension of the melt to a layer of finite height, radially uniform solute distributions are possible only for weak melt flows with an axial velocity away from the solidification front comparable to the growth rate. There is a critical melt velocity for each growth rate at which the solution passes through a singularity and becomes physically inconsistent for stronger melt flows. To resolve these inconsistencies we consider a solidification front presented by a disk of finite radius R0 subject to a strong converging melt flow and obtain an analytic solution showing that the radial solute concentration depends on the radius r as \u223cln1/3(R0/r) and \u223cln(R0/r) close to the rim and at large distances from it. The logarithmic increase of concentration is limited in the vicinity of the symmetry axis by the diffusion becoming effective at a distance comparable to the characteristic thickness of the solute boundary layer. The converging flow causes a solute pile-up forming a logarithmic concentration peak at the symmetry axis which might be an undesirable feature for crystal growth processes."},

The minimization of the zone length and the application of an after heater reduce concave (towards the melt) interface regions which give rise to polycrystalline segments during RF-floating zone crystal growth of complicated intermetallic compounds. However, the adjustment of a complete convex solid-liquid interface shape in RF-floating zone crystal growth requires some additional melt stirring, e.g. by magnetic forces."},

The thresholds of convective instability for both longitudinal and oblique disturbances are calculated numerically and also asymptotically by considering the Hartmann and Prandtl numbers as large and small parameters, respectively. The magnetic field has a stabilizing effect on the flow with the critical temperature gradient for the transition from steady to oscillatory convection increasing as square of the field strength, as also does the critical frequency, while the critical wavelength reduces inversely with field strength. These asymptotics develop in a strong enough magnetic field when the instability is entirely due to the jet of the base flow confined in the Hartmann layer at the free surface. In contrast to the base flow, the critical disturbances, having a long wavelength at small Prandtl numbers, extend from the free surface into the bulk of the liquid layer over a distance exceeding the thickness of the Hartmann layer by a factor O(Pr(- 1/2 )). For Ha \u2264 Pr(- 1/2 ) the instability is influenced by the actual depth of the layer. For such moderate magnetic fields the instability threshold is sensitive to the thermal properties of the bottom of the layer and the dependences of the critical parameters on the field strength are more complicated. In the latter case, various instability modes are possible depending on the thermal boundary conditions and the relative magnitudes of Prandtl and Hartmann numbers."},

The anomalous direction of the thermocapillary flow was explained by the presence of a small amount of a surface-active contaminant - lead adsorbed at the free surface. Two different approaches were used to describe the observed phenomenon. First, the flow was treated as a pure thermocapillary convection with a modified dependence of the surface tension on temperature so that to reproduce the measured velocity distribution. Second, a novel physical model was devised for the flow driven by the gradient of the surface tension induced by the temperature dependence of the concentration of the adsorbed layer of contaminant.

It is found that by applying the concepts of convective, absolute, and global instabilities, theory agrees well with experiment. Two different effects due to the lateral walls are considered. First, the stationary disturbance due to the end walls induces a steady wave pattern spreading over the whole layer as the zero-frequency mode becomes convectively unstable. Second, virtual reflections of traveling disturbances by the lateral walls provide the feedback necessary for the onset of a global instability. In the simplest case, a global neutrally stable state is formed by a couple of transverse waves propagating at the same frequency in opposite directions, so that spatial amplification of one wave compensates for the attenuation of the other. However, the most dangerous self-sustained disturbance is set up by a couple of mirror symmetric oblique waves propagating purely spanwise. For purely thermocapillary-driven flow the threshold of self-sustained instability is just slightly higher than that of the convective instability. However, for liquids of large Prandtl number a moderate buoyancy effect may cause a significant stabilization of self-sustained oscillatory instability."},

The threshold of convective instability with respect to oblique travelling waves is calculated depending on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. For longitudinal waves the critical Marangoni number and the corresponding wavelength are found to increase directly with the induction of a sufficiently strong magnetic field. In general, a coplanar magnetic field causes stabilization of all disturbances except those aligned with the field, which are not influenced at all. With increase of the magnetic field this effect results in the alignment of the most unstable disturbance along the magnetic flux lines. The maximal stabilization is ensured by the magnetic field being imposed spanwise to the basic flow. The corresponding critical Marangoni number is found to be almost insensitive to the thermal properties of the bottom. The strength of the magnetic field necessary to attain the maximal stabilization for a thermally well-conducting bottom is considerably lower than that for an insulating bottom. The basic return flow is found to be linearly stable with respect to purely hydrodynamic disturbances. This effect determines the stability of the basic state with respect to transverse hydrothermal waves at Prandtl number Pr < Prc = 0.018. For such a small Pr no alignment of the critical perturbation with a spanwise magnetic field is possible, and the critical Marangoni number can be increased almost directly with the strength of the magnetic field without limit."},

While the system is linearly stable, regimes with persistent nonlinear turbulence may develop, i.e. the system is subcritical. A perturbation with small but finite amplitude may be sufficient to push the plasma into a regime where nonlinear effects are dominant and thus allow sustained turbulence. The minimum threshold for nonlinear instability to be triggered provides a criterion for assessing whether a tokamak is likely to stay in the quiescent (laminar) regime. At the critical amplitude, instead of transitioning to the turbulent regime or decaying to a laminar state, the trajectory will map out the edge of chaos. Surprisingly, a quasi-travelling-wave solution is found as an attractor on this edge manifold. This simple advecting solution is qualitatively similar to, but simpler than, the avalanche-like bursts seen in earlier turbulent simulations and provides an insight into how turbulence is sustained in subcritical plasma systems. For large flow shearing rate, the system is only convectively unstable, and given a localised initial perturbation, will eventually return to a laminar state at a fixed spatial location."},

The nonlinear dynamics are much less sensitive to sheared flows than the average linear growthrates, and very small amplitude perturbations can lead to sustained turbulence. We explore the general problem of characterizing how and when the transition from near-laminar states to sustained turbulence occurs; a model of the interchange instability being used as a concrete example. These questions are fundamentally nonlinear, and the answers must go beyond the linear transient amplification of small perturbations. Two methods that account for nonlinear interactions are therefore explored here. The first method explored is edge tracking, which identifies the boundary between the basins of attraction of the laminar and turbulent states. Here, the edge is found to be structured around an exact, localized, traveling wave solution; a solution that is qualitatively similar to avalanche-like bursts seen in the turbulent regime. The second method is an application of nonlinear, non-modal stability theory which allows us to identify the smallest disturbances which can trigger turbulence (the minimal seed for the problem) and hence to quantify how stable the laminar regime is. The results obtained from these fully nonlinear methods provides confidence in the derivation of a semi-analytic approximation for the minimal seed. "},

Central to this approach is the question: what diameter tubes support stable Taylor bubbles? In this paper we examine the case of low viscosity Taylor bubbles through experiments and theory and show that they exist in much wider diameter tubes than had previously been reported. In order for the bubbles to be stable a settling period is required to allow the column to sufficiently quiesce. This settling period is compared favourably with the classical stability analysis of Batchelor (1987). We also observe such bubbles rising in an oscillatory manner if the gas input is abruptly curtailed. The oscillations match theoretical predictions well.\n\n"},

Then the transition to turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a set of partial differential equations (the well-known Navier-Stokes equations).

This involves constructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed initial amplitude which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, to maximize a chosen functional over an asymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it identifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values compared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the ratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as the functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe flow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth converged solution provided that the initial amplitude is below the threshold for transition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear) transient growth optimal. At the critical threshold, the optimization seeks out a disturbance that is on the \u2018edge\u2019 of turbulence during the period. Above this threshold, when disturbances trigger turbulence by the end of the period, convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance found to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the \u2018minimal seed\u2019 for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number).

Current experimental and analytical filter models could be calibrated to predict the permeability of a specific filter. However, they fail to provide a reliable estimation for the dependence of the permeability on key parameters such as wall porosity and pore size.This study presents a novel methodology for experimentally determining the permeability of filter walls. The results from four substrates with different porosities and pore sizes are compared with several popular permeability estimation methods (experimental and analytical), and their validity for this application is assessed. It is shown that none of the assessed methods predict all permeability trends for all substrates, for cold or hot flow, indicating that other wall properties besides porosity and pore size are important.The hot flow test results show an increase in permeability with temperature, which is attributed to the effects associated with slip-flow. It is shown that the slip-effect magnitude also varies with the filter wall properties. Existing models that account for the effect of slip are assessed and are shown to underpredict the effect considerably for all four substrates. This is important for the prediction of through-wall losses in applications where permeability increase with temperature is a desirable effect. Further investigation is needed to consider the effect of the high temperatures in exhaust applications."},

In this work, we use a general probabilistic model for T/B cell receptor clone abundances to define \u201cpublicness\u201d or \u201cprivateness\u201d and information-theoretic measures for comparing the frequency of sampled sequences observed across different individuals.

Using synthetic and empirical TCR amino acid sequence data, we perform simulations to study expected clonal commonalities across multiple individuals. Based on our formulae, we compare these simulated results with the analytically predicted mean and variances of the repertoire overlap. Complementing the results on simulated repertoires, we derive explicit expressions for the richness and its uncertainty for specific, single-parameter truncated power-law probability distributions.

We investigate the scaling of the entanglement (or Schmidt) gap \u03b4\u03be, i.e., the lowest-laying gap of the entanglement spectrum, at a two-dimensional quantum critical point. We focus on the paradigmatic quantum spherical model, which exhibits a second-order transition and is mappable to free bosons with an additional external constraint. We analytically show that the Schmidt gap vanishes at the critical point, although only logarithmically. For a system on a torus and the half-system bipartition, the entanglement gap vanishes as \u03c02/ln(L), with L the linear system size. The entanglement gap is nonzero in the paramagnetic phase and exhibits a faster decay in the ordered phase. The rescaled gap \u03b4\u03beln(L) exhibits a crossing for different system sizes at the transition, although logarithmic corrections prevent a precise verification of the finite-size scaling. Interestingly, the change of the entanglement gap across the phase diagram is reflected in the zero-mode eigenvector of the spin-spin correlator. At the transition quantum fluctuations give rise to a nontrivial structure of the eigenvector, whereas in the ordered phase it is flat. We also show that the vanishing of the entanglement gap at criticality can be qualitatively but not quantitatively captured by neglecting the structure of the zero-mode eigenvector."},

While the von Neumann and the R\u00e9nyi entropies exhibit a volume-law for any g and T, the mutual information obeys an area law. The prefactors of the volume-law and of the area-law are regular across the transition, reflecting that universal singular terms vanish at the transition. This implies that the mutual information is dominated by nonuniversal contributions. This hampers its use as a witness of criticality, at least in the spherical model. We also study the logarithmic negativity. For any value of g, T, the negativity exhibits an area-law. The negativity vanishes deep in the paramagnetic phase, it is larger at small temperature, and it decreases upon increasing the temperature. For any g, it exhibits the so-called sudden death, i.e. it is exactly zero for large enough T. The vanishing of the negativity defines a 'death line', which we characterise analytically at small g. Importantly, for any finite T the area-law prefactor is regular across the transition, whereas it develops a cusp-like singularity in the limit . Finally, we consider the single-particle entanglement and negativity spectra. The vast majority of the levels are regular across the transition. Only the larger ones exhibit singularities. These are related to the presence of a zero mode, which reflects the symmetry breaking. This implies the presence of sub-leading singular terms in the entanglement entropies. Interestingly, since the larger levels do not contribute to the negativity, sub-leading singular corrections are expected to be suppressed for the negativity."},

We compare it with the Fisher information for a specific experimental scenario where photon-counting-like measurements are employed. We find how quantum criticality and squeezing are useful resources in the metrological scenario. Second, we obtain the quantum Fisher information for the out-of-equilibrium transition in the dissipative nonequilibrium steady state and investigate how the presence of dissipation affects the parameter estimation. In this scenario, it is known that the critical point is shifted by an amount which depends on the dissipation rate. This is used here to design high precision protocols for a whole range of the transition-driving parameter in the ordered phase. In fact, for certain values of the parameter being estimated, dissipation may be used to obtain higher precision when compared to the equilibrium scenario."},

Conversely, the extension of this idea to the quantum realm, which dates back to Dirac, has proven notoriously difficult due to the noncommutativity of observables. Motivated by recent progress in the experimental control of quantum systems, we propose a framework for the implementation of quantum constraints based on the idea of work protocols, which are dynamically engineered to enforce the constraints. As a proof of principle, we consider the dynamical mean-field approach of the many-body quantum spherical model, which takes the form of a quantum harmonic oscillator plus constraints on the first and second moments of one of its quadratures. The constraints of the model are implemented by the combination of two work protocols, coupling together the first and second moments of the quadrature operators. We find that such constraints affect the equations of motion in a highly nontrivial way, inducing nonlinear behavior and even classical chaos. Interestingly, Gaussianity is preserved at all times. A discussion concerning the robustness of this approach to possible experimental errors is also presented. "},

In the present paper we approach the analysis of this transition using a variational model which allows us to establish the notion of an energy barrier separating the two phases. Using a discrete WKB method we then show that the local tunneling of atoms between adjacent sites lowers this energy barrier and hence facilitates the transition. Within our simplified description, we are thus able to increment the phase diagram of the model with information concerning the height of the barrier separating the metastable minima from the global minimum in each phase, which is an essential aspect for the understanding of the reconfiguration dynamics induced by a quench across a quantum critical point.

Closed systems of equations of motion for several quantum observables are derived and solved exactly. The relationship to the single-mode Dicke model from quantum optics is discussed. The analysis of the interplay of the quantum fluctuation and the dissipation and their influence on the relaxation of the time-dependent magnetisation leads to the distinction of qualitatively different regimes of weak and strong quantum couplings. Considering the model's behaviour in an external field as a simple mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a quantum spherical ferromagnet, the magnetic phase diagramme appears to be re-entrant and presents a quantum analogue of well-established classical examples of fluctuation-induced order.

The exact solution of the model permits to analyse the influence of the spin-anisotropy on the phase diagram and the universality of the critical behaviour in a new way, since the interactions of the quantum spins and their conjugate momenta create new effects. At zero temperature, a quantum critical line is found, which is in the same universality class as the thermal phase transition in the classical spherical model in $d+1$ dimensions. The location of this quantum critical line shows a re-entrant quantum phase transition for dimensions $1"},

The algorithm enables the development of an optimised complex industrial mould with relatively low computational cost. A transient model is validated against multiple experimental trials, providing an adapted interface heat transfer coefficient. A steady state thermal model, based on the casting cycle and thermal behaviour at the mould surface, is developed to evaluate the spatial distribution of temperature and to serve as the initial solution for the subsequent optimisation stage. The adjoint model is then applied to optimise the cooling channel emphasising the minimisation of the temperature standard deviation for the mould surface. The original transient model is applied to the optimised mould configuration via calibration using experimental data obtained from a dedicated aluminium furnace. The optimised cooling channel geometry, which uses a non-uniform cross-section across the entire pipe surface region, improves the pressure drop and cooling uniformity across the mould/cast interface by 24.2% and 31.6%, respectively. The model has been used to optimise cooling channels for a range of industrial high-pressure aluminium die-casting (HPADC) inserts. This has yielded a significant improvement in the mould operational lifetime, rising to almost 130,000 shots compared to 40,000 shots for prior designs."},

Optimisation studies of a full industrial HPADC mould for extending the tool service life has received limited attention due to the high geometrical complexity and the various physics with multi time- and length- scales in addition to the manufacturability limitations. In this work, a new computationallyefficient algorithm that employs the adjoint optimisation method has been developed to optimise the coolant channels layout in a complete mould with various 3D printed inserts. The algorithms significantly reduced the computational time and resources by decoupling the fluid flow in the coolant channels from the tool and simulating them separately. The channel\u2019s heat transfer coefficient values are then interpolated and mapped into the thermal model that implements the adjoint optimisation approach to automatically push/pull the pipes toward the cavity based on the gradient of the optimisation function with respect to the pipe surface location. Using the adjoint method, with a customised multi-objective function, an improvement of 15 % for the cooling uniformity between the mould/cast interface was achieved. Because of the simplified mapping approach, a significant reduction in computational cost was achieved by adopting this strategy. The spatial distribution of the tool temperature and cavity are presented for the baseline and optimised channels. The results showed that the optimised channels not only have variations in layout but also in their cross-sectional shape at different locations to satisfy the objective function. The optimised insert designs have been applied inproduction, yielding a significant increase in tool service lifespan, reaching approximately of 130,000 shots. "},

These novel processes are uninhibited by the conventional limitations of computer numerical control (CNC) machining methods and allow the cooling channel layout of the mould cavity to be created freely. HPDC bears many similarities to injection moulding; however, metal forming engenders more challenging operating conditions than those associated with polymers. Therefore, the development of an optimal cooling channel layout for a rapid prototyped mould insert is of considerable interest to industry. Previous work has shown that the cooling of corners can be challenging, as typical cooling channels with circular cross sections fail to provide sufficient heat flux in these regions. This is a consequence of the small surface area of the sections of the cooling pipes exposed to the corners and their distance from the cast. Recent studies have explored various shape optimisation approaches [1, 2] that have demonstrated improvements over conventional cooling channels. The adjoint optimisation approach developed by Lions and Pironneau [3, 4] is a powerful numerical method that can be used to calculate a pre-defined mesh sensitivity based on an objective function that can then be used to deform the shape of the geometry. Whilst adjoint optimisation has been successfully applied in aeronautical applications [5], its potential application in heat transfer has received limited attention. This extended abstract presents preliminary adjoint optimisation results as a \u2018proof of concept\u2019 for the development of a cooling channel optimisation strategy for HPDC mould inserts. We are interested in achieving uniform heat transfer/cooling, minimising pressure drop between inlet and outlet flow and reducing thermal fatigue to extend tooling life"},

Designing cooling channels that can achieve a uniform temperature throughout the tool-cast interface during the moulding process can limit part warping and sink marks, internal part stresses, and increase tool life. However, the design of the embedded cooling channels requires high computational resources to model the heat transfer process for the cast, mould, and coolant from the moment aluminium is injected into the cavity until the injection for the next cycle. To enable the examination of the effect of various parameters, a simplified 3-D CFD conjugate heat transfer model is introduced by considering the experimental observations. The model decouples the cast part from the mould. A volumetric heat source term is added to the energy equation to represent the solidification energy, and accordingly the heat flux is evaluated on its surface that has been set to a uniform temperature. The heat flux is then compared with that obtained from the mould surface for a specific cooling channel layout. With this approach it is possible for the designer to rapidly assess the cooling system without incurring significant computational cost. The model reveals the undercooled and overcooled regions, which are then matched with the observational results obtained by analysing the tools and the aluminium cast surface. The results prove that the model can be employed to develop a baseline design of the cooling channel network for a complex geometry before applying an optimisation technique. It can also be useful for assessing the effect of various parameters, and to carry out a parametric sensitivity study with limited computational cost. The limitations of the model are evaluated and discussed in this work."},

The computational cost of the method is independent of the number of design variables, which makes it an attractive approach for problems with large design spaces. The method was originally developed by Lions and Pironneau [1,2] in the 1970s, and has gained popularity in the aeronautical industries [3], however to date, its uptake in heat transfer applications is limited. In this study, we use the adjoint method to optimise the shape of conformal cooling channels for aluminium casting mould inserts. Traditional moulding processes consist of three main phases, filling, cooling and ejection, where cooling occupies up to 80% of the total moulding cycle. Design of conformal cooling channels using solid freeform fabrication (SFF) methods such as 3D printing have been carried out by Sachs et al. [4] and show a significant reduction in cycle time and part distortion by 15% and 9% respectively, compared with conventional cooling lines from straight CNC drill. The objective of this study is to morph the shape of conformal cooling channels using various objective functions, such as those that maximise heat transfer, or minimise pressure drop, and to assess the impact of these shape modifications upon the performance of the mould insert.
